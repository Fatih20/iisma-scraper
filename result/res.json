Our objective is to cut through common narratives provided by pundits, politicians, journalists, and the typical voter to understand when presidents are more (or less) likely to influence public policy. Put simply, when (and how) do presidents exercise power? Answers to this question are both complicated and difficult to evaluate."},{"title":"The Comparative Study of Culture","description":"This introductory course to cultural anthropology seeks to expand students’ understanding about the diversity of the human condition. Cultural anthropologists are united in their commitment to three poles of research: fieldwork, a method based on long-term immersion in a life-world; ethnography, the written representation of peoples, places, and fieldwork experiences; and theory, evolving concepts that anthropologists try to build through their ethnographies to address “big questions” about constantly changing human societies. In this class, we will use these three poles to challenge taken-for-granted assumptions about culture, race, gender, sexuality, kinship, magic, environment, science, and modernity. Using ethnographic accounts from around the world, we will come to understand these categories not as “natural truths” but rather as “social facts” – that is, the result of cultural contexts and historical particularities. We will cover key theoretical thinkers and central themes in anthropological scholarship."},{"title":"The Globalization of Biomedicine","description":"When people say “global health,” they usually mean delivering Western medicine in low-resource settings. This assumes that medicine is a universal good. Is it? Or is biomedicine also a “culture” – with values, practices, and understandings built in a particular place and time? What are medicine’s ethics, symbols, economies, experiences of the body, and politics? What happens when these things run up against other ways of viewing the world? In this course, through scholarship and popular media, and through the instructor’s experiences as a practicing physician and anthropologist, we will explore mind-bending paradoxes about what we assume to be true, explore aspects of medical practice, and describe why those practices often have unexpected results when they travel."},{"title":"The Anthropology of Food","description":"Do you eat to live, or live to eat? If the latter, this course may be for you. As anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss wrote, the plants and animals around us are not just good to eat, they are good to think with and through. Anthropologists study the human condition in all its forms, including how we evolved as a species, how we communicate, how we lived in the historic and prehistoric past, and how we organize our lives in different parts of the world today. In the realm of food, we thus pay close attention to the ways in which humans hunt, fish, gather, and grow food, how we get enough calories to survive in differing environments, how food helps us to constitute families, religious identities, and other social networks, and even how food comes to be a source and a symptom of social inequality."},{"title":"Anthropologies of Insurgency: Bandits, Rebels and Freedom Fighters","description":"This course explores the interlinked categories of rebel, bandit, and freedom fighter to understand insurgency from an anthropological viewpoint. Privileging sociological and micropolitical analysis, the course approaches specific instances of illegal use of force in their socio-cultural and historic settings, and builds toward a consideration of insurgency from “the actors’ points of view”. Through the categories of the rebel, bandit, and insurgent, the course considers broader issues of structure and agency, state power and sovereignty, and definitions of legal and illegal uses of force from the oblique angle of those whose violence is classified as illegitimate."},{"title":"Intro to Amer Literature:  American Dream, American Nightmare","description":"The long-standing belief that the United States is in some sense a chosen nation has multiple sources. The Puritans hailed the New World as the last refuge of righteousness in a corrupt world, the Framers of the US Constitution thought that their experiment in democracy turned a new page in world history, and later propagandists proclaimed America the land of opportunity open to all races and creeds. The best and most enduring prose fiction written in this country neither accepts nor rejects these native myths but fuses them into one complex response. Bitter denunciations of the American Dream tend to be fueled by a hidden idealism; overt celebrations of the same idea can betray awareness of its tragic costs. In this course we shall trace this ambivalence about an idealized “America” in writing over the past two centuries. Authors to be considered include, among others, Herman Melville, Rebecca Harding Davis, Stephen Crane, Zora Neale Hurston, Don DeLillo, and Louise Erdrich."},{"title":"Green Indigeneity","description":"This course examines environmental issues as they engage, relate to, ally and contradict with indigenous belongings to land and place in the Pacific Islands, continental U.S., and beyond. We will examine the histories of colonialism and imperialism that set the stage for contemporary formations militarization, tourism, national parks, and genetically modified organisms, issues that engage both questions of sustainability and indigenous political sovereignty."},{"title":"Asian American Literature and Culture","description":"We will survey in this course the representations of and by Asian American subjects in U.S. cultural production since the late nineteenth century. This course explores the ways in which the cultural and literary production that arises out of the contradictions of U.S. democracy “displace,” in the words of cultural studies scholar Lisa Lowe, “the fiction of reconciliation”—the ways in which the cultural forms of Asian America “disrupt the myth of national identity by revealing its gaps and fissures.”"},{"title":"Language and Culture","description":"While languages and cultures have each been described as tight systems of meaningful coherence that reinforce each other, communication in social life is more slippery than that, rife with contradictions and conflicts. People, for instance, may justify hierarchies by referring to linguistic or cultural standards even when doctors or CEOs themselves speak “ungrammatically.” This course surveys research and reflection on language as a part of “culture,” drawing on literature in anthropology, linguistics, and related fields. Included are scholars who see culture as primarily cognitive (and relative) ways of ‘knowing’, such as how people conceive of categories like space and time, or how they classify people and things."},{"title":"Peoples and Cultures of Southeast Asia","description":"This course offers a close look at contemporary research on Southeast Asia. The emphasis will be on the in-depth understanding gained through long-term anthropological fieldwork. We will read and discuss a selection of ethnographic monographs from across the region. Readings will be chosen from locations in both mainland (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam) and archipelagic (The Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Timor Leste) Southeast Asia."},{"title":"Early American Cultural History","description":"Where does American culture come from? What can things like maps, pirates, religious revivals, and even a giant cheese tell us about the making of America? This course will examine culture in the North American colonies and borderlands, and in the newly formed United States in the period before 1876. We will define culture broadly in this class to consider social customs and beliefs as well as more specific forms of literary and artistic expression. We will explore how culture shaped critical elements of American history, including: settler colonialism and indigenous resistance; emerging American identities and constructions of gender, sexuality, race, and class; slavery and abolitionism; democratic practices and religious participation; and changing borders and inhabitants of an expanding United States."},{"title":"Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies","description":"A survey introduction to the critical, theoretical, and historical study of women and gender from feminist and cross-cultural perspectives. Readings range across a wide body of feminist scholarship in order to familiarize students with key questions, theoretical tools, and issues within the field. The course aims to sharpen critical awareness of how gender operates in institutional and cultural contexts, in students’ own lives and the lives of others. Two questions are central to the course: How is gender created and maintained through social practices (e.g., ideology or media representations)?; How do these gendered social practices intersect with other social categories, such as race, ethnicity, class, disability, and sexuality?"},{"title":"The History of Asian Americans in Michigan","description":"This course will examine the long and often overlooked history of Asian Americans in Michigan with particular attention to activist efforts both at the University and off campus.With an emphasis on developing our own public history projects, this course will allow students to explore hands-on learning, and developing skills in the areas of library and web-based research, learning from community-driven research projects, and the ethical questions that such projects raise. In addition to working in campus libraries, the course will feature a number of guest speakers who have led their own community-based efforts to record their histories."},{"title":"The Office: Business, Technology and the Shape of Work in the West","description":"The Office explores the space in which work and business has been centered, the objects and technologies that have shaped and reshaped its functions, and the people that have worked within its walls. Through lectures, readings, and presentations that draw upon the scholarship and insight of a diversity of fields, it offers an object- and technology-centered history of the Western business workplace, and traces the key innovations in the structure and function of the office from Ancient Rome to the Zoom-space. This course will investigate the broad significance of seemingly everyday objects and the people that have used them and trace across space and time the mutual impact, interaction, and interconnectedness of business, technology, and society."},{"title":"Art of the Story","description":"Humans are story-telling animals. From our earliest entrance into language as young children, we are enthralled, inspired, and instructed by stories. Reading a wide variety of examples, we will analyze the elements of the story as a form of communication and entertainment, and we will think through how the form of the story helps us to understand, retain, and analyze our experiences. Assignments will include your written analyses of stories we read as well as the stories you write."},{"title":"Detroit State of Mind: Literary Representations of the Motor City","description":"Detroit is a city of stark contradictions. On the one hand, as the original home of the universally beloved black-owned music label Motown, it has become one of the most potent symbols of America’s integrated popular culture, while, on the other hand, the Detroit riots of 1943 and 1967 have made it all but synonymous with black-white racial strife. Once heralded as an “arsenal of democracy,” it nonetheless has a long history of antidemocratic policies and social movements. Although a site of tremendous wealth production and class mobility throughout the twentieth century, it filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and currently has the highest poverty rate of any major American city. How can we make sense of such a place? In this course, we will attempt to do so by turning to the writers, filmmakers, musicians, and poets whose works revolve around life in the Motor City. We will pay special attention to how these authors represent class conflict and race."}],"intakeStatistics":{}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/s83-new-york-university/","name":"New York University","available":true,"academicPeriod":{"start":"May 27, 2024","end":"August 09, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":7.5,"toefl":100,"det":125,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Applied Data Analytics","description":"Data Science is the process of learning from data in order to gain useful predictive insights.

Students interrogate ideas,images, and texts within their rhetorical and historical contexts.They learn various tools for analyzing the structure of arguments and logical strategies. At the same time, students read texts that challenge them to reexamine the cultural realities we take for granted."},{"title":"Current Political Issues","description":"The specific theme of Current Politics Issues will change each time it is offered in order to provide students with an opportunity to focus on current issues related to Politics. Students will be able to take the course twice with a different subtitle for a total of 4 units."},{"title":"Digital Storytelling","description":"Whenever we want to communicate an idea, provide information, make someone feel an emotion, buy a product, or simply entertain our friends, we tell a story. Today, that story will likely be told digitally – as a website, a blog, or through social media, texts, tweets, podcasts, etc. This course examines the different digital media forms, the relationship between those forms, and guidelines for choosing which medium or combination of media is best for a given communications project. Concentrating on media theory, design, and analysis rather than specific technologies, the course provides an overview of the creative toolset, critical precepts and primary concepts of digital media making. By the end of the semester, each student will have completed a series of assignments in several media formats, an individual project, and a collaborative project. The group and final individual project can utilize any of the digital forms discussed in the class."},{"title":"International Trade and Investment","description":"Balancing political-economic and behavioral analysis, this course has three objectives. The first is to develop knowledge of the political-economic contexts of strategic managerial decision-making in foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade. Emphasis is placed on aggregate bilateral contexts such as the European Union vis-a-vis other regional-trade entities (e.g., NAFTA and the Southern Africa Development Union) and industry-level considerations. Second, participants will develop skills in assessing desirable institutional qualities of foreign direct investment vehicles such as international joint ventures and the negotiation of same. The third objective of the course is to develop knowledge of behavioral problems and issues associated with bicultural/intercultural organizations. In this context, participants will acquire knowledge of structural and procedural responses in selected policy-making domains and functional areas of international management."},{"title":"Interrogating Political Globalization","description":"This course considers political globalization and its impact on the state and state sovereignty. To begin with, then, ‘globalization’ is, itself, a complex, contested, fluid and flexible concept; it means different things to different people, in different contexts. What it means from a political perspective, to whom and why will be our focal points of inquiry. In particular, we will look closely at the implications of globalization for the state. This is especially salient given the traditional notion of the state as a sovereign authority in an age in which there is a proliferation of international and regional organizations, and of multi-national corporations – many of which have larger sales revenues than the entire economies of most countries in the context of a world economy that appears to be beyond the control of many states. First, we will consider various ideas of globalization, and of political globalization, and their genesis. We then turn to the literature concerned with the seeming transformation of the sovereign state, and of the social relations brought about by globalization. We will also explore ethnographic and critical approaches to the study of political globalization. Throughout the semester, we will be considering how political globalization “works” as a discourse, how it is experienced, what its attributes might be, what shifts in political- economic power relations the term denotes, and how we might develop a critical approach to its study."},{"title":"Multicultural communications","description":"Organizations are part of the larger cultures in which they exist. This course examines multicultural communication on two levels: globally, using insights from anthropology, sociology, media studies, social psychology, linguistics; and nationally, exploring the values and behaviors of diverse cultural groups in the United States."},{"title":"Psychology of Women","description":"This course examines the nature and development of gender roles and the lifelong impact of gender on women’s experiences. The course introduces students to differing theoretical perspectives, from Freud to feminist psychologists and contemporary writers, and covers recent empirical research on the development of gender roles and gender differences. Topics include the influences of biology, family, culture, and society in shaping gender identity and expectations; and the differential treatment of males and females in school, the workplace, and the media. This is an in-depth review of topics of special concern to women, such as sexuality, friendships and family, intimate relationships, the experience of parenting, and exploitation and violence"},{"title":"Sustainable Management Principles","description":"This course is designed to explore alternative approaches to management in the 21st century. Its primary objective is to educate and engage students on the concept and practice of sustainable management—an emerging discipline that addresses management functions in light of the increasing evidence and perceived threats to the planet. With unprecedented developments in global demographics, climate change, and questionable resource use patterns, there is an urgent need to reconsider some foundational principles and traditional management practices within businesses and other organizations."},{"title":"World Cultures","description":"This course examines the history and cultural practices of various societies traditionally recognized by the West as belonging to ‘Asia’. Our discussion will focus on the modern period, spanning from the turn of the 19th century to the present day. We will delve into several well-known Asian countries, as identified in research, emphasizing the southeastern and eastern regions of the continent. Conceptually, we will critically re-examine the notion of ‘Asia’ in relation to Western colonialism and transmigration, placing particular emphasis on the ‘Asian American’ experience in the U.S. context and the emerging pan-Asian identities. Using an anthropological framework, the course will thematically explore the broad concept of ‘Asia’ through key cultural and societal aspects, including religion and customs, language, education, economy, as well as arts and entertainment."}],"intakeStatistics":{}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/s82-georgetown-university/","name":"Georgetown University","available":true,"location":"Washington, DC, USA","academicPeriod":{"start":"August 28, 2024","end":"December 21, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":78,"det":100,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"ASEAN: Progress, Problems, Promise","description":"With ten member states, a population of 630 million, strategic sea lanes, and growing economies, ASEAN is a force on the world’s stage and a dynamic economic and political influence in an increasingly vital Southeast Asia. As the world’s 7th largest economy. ASEAN provides a significant platform for multilateral engagement and integration within the Asia region. It is especially important to the United States — as its 4th largest trading partner and a strategic ally in fighting the terrorist threat and handling issues like drug and human trafficking, non-proliferation, transnational crime, and health and humanitarian concerns. This seminar will examine ASEAN’s formation in 1967, policies, and progress until now. It will also discuss past and present problems, particularly the Rohingya crisis and the South China Sea dispute. The course will conclude by looking at opportunities ahead for ASEAN and its continued promise – for the vibrant SE Asia region, Asia, and the world."},{"title":"Comparative Political Systems","description":"This course offers a broad introduction to comparative politics, the subfield of political science concerned mainly with political ideas, institutions, and behavior within states. The course examines such themes as the origins and functions of states, formal institutions such as legislatures and executives, the variety and impact of electoral systems, the nature of democracy and autocracy, internal and external challenges to political order, and the impact of international and domestic factors on state performance. Discussions of theoretical and cross-regional issues will be accompanied by treatment of individual countries and contexts. This course counts for the Comparative Government distribution requirement. This course has been renumbered, effective Fall 2014. A student who earned credit for GOVT 121 Comparative Political Systems in a prior term should not enroll and cannot earn credit in this class."},{"title":"Examining Crises Through Science","description":"The SFS INAF180 science courses are designed to teach students science that is relevant to international affairs. The sections consist of a series of courses that will focus on learning the science that is necessary to understand global, societal challenges such as climate change, emerging infectious disease, and food security, among many others. To facilitate active learning and hands-on opportunities, as well as to ensure an interactive experience, enrollment will be limited to 20 students per section. Additionally, to build a sense of community among incoming freshmen, some sections will be limited to freshmen only. Section information text: News headlines around the world are dominated by crises and disasters involving major threats to basic human needs for security, clean water and air, food, and health: Cape Town, South Africa is at risk of running out of fresh water, an Ebola outbreak rages in West Africa, and honeybees are suddenly disappearing. In these cases and others, an understanding science is required to understand how the crisis or disaster happened, what caused it, and how it might be resolved. Science plays a critical role in informing governments, communities, non-profits and individuals who need to make important decisions in response to such crises. In this course, we will examine these cases and others through the lens of science. By studying these cases, you will develop a better understanding of the role of science in policy-relevant issues and international affairs. You will also develop a stronger understanding of the process of science and how scientific understanding is developed, tested, and revised. Given the complex, interdisciplinary nature of these issues, we will focus on learning scientific principles and methods from a broad array of scientific fields including biology, chemistry, geosciences, and environmental sciences. The course will also highlight the importance of interdisciplinary science. This course is cross-listed with ENST180-01."},{"title":"Fundamentals of Finance","description":"This course is a survey course, designed to explore the major concepts in corporate finance. Topics include Time Value of Money; Net Present Value/Internal Rate of Return; Valuation of Stocks and Bonds; Financial Statements/Ratios; Managing Growth; Discounted Cash Flow; Risk, Return and the Cost of Capital; Capital Structure; Dividends; Raising Capital/Going Public; Mergers and Acquisitions; and Corporate Restructuring. The course focuses on applications of finance to assist students outside the Business School to understand financial statements, apply financial analytical techniques, and learn the basics of the capital markets. Note: students will not be expected to have prior knowledge of course concepts."},{"title":"Global South: Politics, Literature & Film","description":"The Global South: Politics, Literature and Film: In literary and cultural studies, the Global South has been employed in a transnational sense to address spaces and peoples impacted by the legacies of colonization as well as globalization. The course would explore historical, cultural, literary and cinematic applications of the term, especially in the context of Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Oceania. Section information text: As the Cold War era ended, the transnational term “Global South” largely supplanted the “Third World” to refer to geographical regions with large inequalities in living standards, life expectancy, and access to resources. The spaces and peoples of the Global South have not only experienced political, social, and economic upheaval, but have also faced seemingly insurmountable challenges brought on by poverty, hunger, disease, war, human and civil rights violations, displacement, migration, and environmental degradation. Global South countries have also been greatly impacted by globalization and the legacies of colonialism. However, should the Global South just be reduced to a metaphor for underdevelopment and poverty? To answer this question, we will explore the ways in which the Global South, especially its culture and politics, are represented and described in literature and film from regions as diverse as the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, and Oceania. We will examine how literary and cinematic representations reinforce, transform, and/or disrupt notions of a developing Global South. In doing so, we will also consider and interrogate the idea of a “developed” Global North."},{"title":"International Economics","description":"The course studies the economic relationships among countries. The first part of the course will focus on International trade and some of the popular trade theories. We will explore how trade can be explained by differences in absolute and comparative advantage as seen in the well-known Ricardian model and analyze the effects of trade on income distribution as well as see different sources of gains that arise when countries trade with each other. In addition, we will also study how trade takes place when two countries differ in resources or factor endowments as seen in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. We will also cover certain important issues in trade policy – such as the benefits and costs of tariffs, subsidies and trade quotas, that accrue to countries using these instruments. The second part of the course will cover some key concepts and issues in international macroeconomics, such as exchange rates, balance of payments, trade and financial accounts, exchange rate regimes. In particular, we will focus on some pertinent questions such as what causes countries to run trade surpluses or deficits with their trading partners? How are such imbalances resolved over time? What causes banking and currency crises in open economies? What factors are responsible for financial contagion between economies, and how can governments handle international financial instability? We also spend time looking at the role played by exchange rates in the financial crises, and how adopting different exchange rate regimes can fulfill different policy objectives of the countries."},{"title":"International Relations","description":"This course provides an introduction to key theories, concepts, historical events, and contemporary issues in the study of international relations (IR). The course has six learning objectives: Students will come to understand (1) the fundamental concepts unique to the field of international relations; (2) the major theories of international conflict and cooperation, particularly realist, liberal, and constructivist theories; and (3) several watershed conflicts in the last century, including World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Students will then apply this theoretical and empirical knowledge to make sense of salient contemporary issues in (4) international security (including nuclear weapons and proliferation, ethnic conflict, civil war, and terrorism), (5) political economy (including trade, finance, and globalization), and (6) global governance (including international law, human rights, humanitarian intervention, and the environment). In short, the course is meant to provide students with the tools to analyze contemporary international affairs and debates in a rigorous and sophisticated manner."},{"title":"Poverty and Inequality","description":"This course offers an introduction to the economics of poverty: how to measure it, why it exists, and how to alleviate it.

Major emphasis is on the uses and limitations of financial statements. Emphasis is placed on applying the financial statement analysis skills taught in the course to (1) interpreting annual reports of publicly traded companies; (2) using online stock screening and analysis software; and (3) understanding SEC enforcement actions and articles from the business press."},{"title":"Religion, Ethics, World Affairs","description":"Overview Under the post-World War II Liberal World Order, religion and ethics were able to shape and influence the course of international affairs. Human rights, religious pluralism, and democracy all advanced. Religious groups were active in peacemaking, the settlement of refugees, relief and development work and of coalitions supporting humanitarian intervention. The U.S., Canada and the U.K. appointed ambassadors and established offices for international religious freedom. With the eclipse of the Liberal World Order, the growth of nationalism, the spread of xenophobia and the advance of “illiberal democracy,” it is growing harder to advance the international agenda of religious groups, humanitarian agencies and value-based foreign policy lobbies. The class will examine the gains made under the Liberal World Order and then inquire as to the possible pathways for religion and ethics to contribute to in today’s swirling international environment. Section information text: Recent decades have seen a resurgence of religion in world politics. With the end of the Cold War, the attacks of September 11 and the acceleration of globalization, issues with a religious and ethical dimension have moved up the national and international agenda. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; the Arab Spring; the rise of religious movements with a political agenda in Egypt, India and the US; the explosive success and territorial gains of the Islamic State; immigration to Europe; refugee status in the U.S., and “culture wars” in the United States– these are only some of the issues and areas in which religion plays a key role. Among the topics we shall examine this semester are: Secularization theory and the persistence of religion; religion and violence; nonviolence, just war and peacemaking; globalization and transnationalism; global human development; migration and refugee flows; religious freedom and human rights; forgiveness and reconciliation; religious institutions and leaders in international politics, and religion and U.S. foreign policy.

Some seats in this class are reserved."},{"title":"US Political Systems","description":"Government 1200 provides students with a broad understanding of the political system in the United States. It is one of the four introductory courses in the Department of Government. The goal of the class is to train students both as citizens and as scholars. As citizens, students will learn the shared history of U.S. politics and be able to think critically about how the system has succeeded and failed. As scholars, students will be introduced to the theoretical and analytical tools of political science as applied to American government. By the end of the semester students will 1) Be politically literate, knowing core historical and contemporary facts about the U.S. political system 2) Understand important theories about U.S. politics, including theories about the importance and functioning of political institutions, the roots of popular political preferences, and the functioning and consequences of elections."}],"intakeStatistics":{}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/s100-university-of-toronto/","name":"University of Toronto","available":true,"location":"Toronto, Canada","academicPeriod":{"start":"University The, of","end":"2024 December, The"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":89,"det":120,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Introduction to Biological Anthropology and Archaeology","description":"Anthropology is the global and holistic study of human biology and behaviour, and includes four subfields: biological anthropology, archaeology, sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology.

Chemistry will be taught on a need-to-know basis in order to consider some contemporary applications. The course will focus on three themes in the realm of human health: nutrition for the prevention of disease, diagnostic tests for the detection of disease and drug discovery for the treatment of disease. Among the questions that may be addressed are “What is the nutritional difference between vitamins from foods and those from supplements?”, “Should ketchup be considered a vegetable?”, “How do diagnostic strips work?”, “What advances in microfluidics have provided inexpensive diagnostics for use in remote areas?”, “How are drug targets identified?”, and “What is the path from drug discovery to bringing a drug to market?”. The roles of nutritional, analytical and medicinal chemistry in these processes will be studied."},{"title":"Planet Earth","description":"We discuss the age and origin of the Earth, the nature of its deep interior, the origin of mountains, oceans, earthquakes and volcanoes, and show how these features are related in a unifying theory known as Plate Tectonics, that explains how the evolution of the Earth’s surface is driven by internal processes. Practicals will include laboratory exercises devoted to the understanding and recognition of minerals, rocks and geological structures."},{"title":"Earth, Climate & Life","description":"Life as we know it is completely dependent on our planet. The Earth is an integrated system, where the ocean, atmosphere, life and planet interact with and affect one another. The evolution of the smallest organisms has drastically changed Earth’s climate, and small changes in Earth’s climate have a profound effect on the distribution of life. Understanding how organisms feed, breath, grow, and reproduce are integral to mitigating large-scale climate changes and organic cycles, and how this will affect the Earth as a system. Processes such as plate tectonics produces an ever changing surface, and has been a major control on how and when life evolved and flourished. After introducing how the Earth works, topics discussed will include how life on Earth has evolved, how large-scale geological processes affect climate and life and how ecosystems have changed in response to weather and climate change. We will also discuss the effect that our species has had on this planet; from the sudden shifts in stability of Earth’s systems, to feedback cycles, to use of resources and sustainability."},{"title":"Ecology","description":"An introduction to the scientific study of ecology, emphasizing the structure and dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems.

Beginning with the cinematic revolution signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism (of Rossellini and De Sica), we will follow the evolution of postwar cinema through the French New Wave (of Godard, Resnais, and Varda), American movies of the 1950s and 1960s (including the New Hollywood cinema of Coppola and Scorsese), and the various other new wave movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (such as the New German Cinema). We will then selectively examine some of the most important films of the last two decades, including those of U.S. independent film movement and movies from Iran, China, and elsewhere in an expanding global cinema culture. There will be precise attention paid to formal and stylistic techniques in editing, mise-en-scene, and sound, as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of film. At the same time, those formal features will be closely linked to historical and cultural distinctions and changes, ranging from the Paramount Decision of 1948 to the digital convergences that are defining screen culture today. There are no perquisites. Requirements will include readings in film history and film analysis, an analytical essay, a research paper, a final exam, and active participation."},{"title":"The Twentieth Century: Whose American Dream?","description":"Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life. This piece of conventional wisdom has long led Americans to believe that if we love to do something, it can’t be work. It becomes, essentially, a labor of love–and yet, doesn’t even a work of art require… work? In this survey course of twentieth-century American literature, we will consider the relationship between the American Dream, the figure of the “worker,” and artistic labor writ large. Through our readings of novels, poetry, and films, we will explore contemporary notions about workers in the context of social and economic developments throughout the century, paying particular attention to texts that challenge the association of the figure of “the worker” with heteronormative white masculinity and the industrial jobs that make up a shrinking portion of the U.S. economy."},{"title":"Judgment and Decisions","description":"Thinking, judgment, and personal and societal decision making, with emphasis on fallacies and biases."},{"title":"Experimental Organic Chemistry","description":"A basic laboratory course in which both the theoretical and practical aspects of a variety of organic reactions and multistep syntheses are emphasized.

Students will read this book throughout the semester to support their understanding of the community that they will be serving. (2) Statutory tax system. Students will learn about the tax system as it relates to individuals and sole proprietors. The VITA training covers general tax preparation, with a specific focus on tax credits available to VITA-eligible taxpayers and the use of VITA software. In addition, one session of the course will include a guest lecture/discussion. It will focus on statutory tax issues related to organizational form choice for self-employed and gig economy workers, which is an important statutory issue in low-income communities. (3) Social policy debate. Tax policy, including deductions, subsidies and credits, are one tool that lawmakers can use to get more cash in the hands of individuals and families, especially for low-income groups. Students will consider the effectiveness and usefulness of tax policies relative to other tools that the government has available. There are three guest lecturers for the sessions on tax policy. (4) Working with people. Volunteering with VITA requires students to work with people from a low-income community on the sensitive issue of personal finances. Students will learn to discuss sensitive financial issues with lower-income adults (including many seniors) through readings and in-class discussions, and by reflecting on their real-life experiences in the local community. This skill is important in a variety of roles such as healthcare (physicians and nurses), business (e.g., the HR function), and education. The community service part of the course is volunteering with VITA, which is the IRS’s “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance” program. Following training, students will perform tax services for the West Philadelphia community during the tax season. The course will meet once a week in three-hour sessions for 8-9 weeks during the Spring semester. Students are expected to be in the field performing service throughout a significant portion of the semester. As described on the IRS website, the VITA program has operated for over 50 years. Volunteers offer free tax help to people who need assistance in preparing their own tax returns, including: • People who generally make $58,000 or less • Persons with disabilities; and • Limited English-speaking taxpayers."},{"title":"Work, Power, and Inequality","description":"From the immigrant shirtwaist sewers’ strike of 1909 to the 2021 union declaration by engineers Google, MGMT004 examines imbalances of power in the workplace and responses to perceived abuses of employer power. We investigate, via an exploration of government regulations and an examination of movements like #MeToo, how government and firm-level human capital policies shape workforce inequalities of race and gender. Throughout the course, we compare the United States with other countries to assess how national institutions influence both productivity and profitability (for firms) and fairness and stability (for workers)."},{"title":"Gender and Society","description":"This course will introduce students to the ways in which sex, gender, and sexuality mark our bodies, influence our perceptions of self and others, organize families and work like, delimit opportunities for individuals and groups of people, as well as impact the terms of local and transnational economic exchange. We will explore the ways in which sex, gender, and sexuality work with other markers of difference and social status such as race, age, nationality, and ability to further demarcate possibilities, freedoms, choices, and opportunities available to people."},{"title":"Word Musics and Culture","description":"This course examines how we as consumers in the “Western” world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways– particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of “World Music” by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process."},{"title":"Global Media","description":"This course explores a broad media landscape through new critical and conceptual approaches. It is designated as a Benjamin Franklin Seminar. This course maps the footprints of television at a global scale. Adopting comparative approaches, we will be studying TV’s formation of national and global discourses, and thereby recognizing not only television’s impact on processes of globalization, but also the ability of television to matter globally. Working through concepts of “broadcasting,” “flow,” “circulation,” and “circumvention,” the course examines the movement of (and blocks encountered by) television programs and signals across national borders and cultures. The course particularly focuses on how global television cultures have been transformed due to shifts from broadcasting technologies to (Internet) streaming services? Navigating from United States and Cuba to India and Egypt, the readings in the course illuminate how particular televisual genres, institutions, and reception practices emerged in various countries during specific historical periods."},{"title":"Introduction to Asian American Studies","description":"According to the U.S. Census, there are approximately 21 million Asian residents in the U.S. that comprise almost 6 percent of the total population. This relatively small number disguises the critical experiences Asian American communities face in both the local and transnational context. Yet, Asian Americans constitute one of the most heterogeneous racial groups within the U.S. Over the course of this semester we will read about and actively discuss the history of Asian immigration to the U.S., the social construction and experience of race in the U.S., and the political, economic, and cultural contributions of Asian Americans. We will also examine how Asian Americans negotiate/deploy their culture and ethnicity to achieve recognition in multicultural America and how the construction of Asian American identity intersects with class, gender, and sexuality."},{"title":"Applied Data Analysis","description":"This course will examine how and when data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize (a) the critical role of an underlying economic theory of behavior in interpreting data and guiding analysis, as well as (b) a range of advanced techniques for inferring causality from data, such as randomized controlled trials, regression discontinuity, difference-in-difference, audit study (mystery shopping) approaches and stock-market event studies. The issue of causality, and the relevance of thinking about models and methods for inferring causality, is just as central and important for “Big Data” as it is when working with traditional data sets in business and public policy. The emphasis will not be on proofs and derivations but rather on understanding the underlying concepts, the practical use, implications and limitations of techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy, to develop the skills to use data analysis to make better decisions. All analysis will be conducted using R. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers able to interpret and evaluate empirical studies as well as expert producers of convincing empirical analysis themselves."},{"title":"Introduction to Micro Economics","description":"Introduction to economic analysis and its application.

Developmental Psychology is a diverse field that studies the changes that occur with age and experience and how we can explain these changes. The field encompasses changes in physicalgrowth, perceptual systems, cognitive systems, social interactions and and much more. We will study the development of perception, cognition, language,academic achievement, emotion regulation, personality, moral reasoning,and attachment. We will review theories of development and ask how these theories explain experimental findings. While the focus is on human development, when relevant, research with animals will be used as a basis for comparison."},{"title":"Language and Social Identity","description":"Language is an important part of both human cognition as well as social organization. Our identities, our societies, and our cultures are all informed by and how we use language. Language interacts with the social, political and economic power structures in crucial ways.

Coupled with growing awareness of these issues is the emerging sense that traditional government programs and charities may be unable to solve these problems – at least, not alone. What may be needed are new strategies – strategies borne of (a) a deep understanding of the issues; (b) interdisciplinary collaboration; and (c) access to business knowledge, frameworks, and resources. This course is designed to provide the information, strategies, examples, and analytical mindset to make students more rigorous, insightful, and effective in analyzing social ills and crafting potential solutions. Together, a cross-disciplinary group of undergraduate students, including students in Wharton, the College, and other Penn Schools, will examine the nature and extent of two pressing social problems – food insecurity and barriers to post-secondary education – and current approaches to solving these problems."},{"title":"Climate Change","description":"Climate change is happening right now! Climate change is a hoax this is normal variation! Climate change is something we can worry about in 50 to 100 years, no need to worry about it now. On an almost daily basis we are bombarded by mixed messages about climate in the media. Who is right? What is the truth? This course will examine the cryosphere and build on the previous Climate Certificate courses CLCH 160 Oceanography and CLCH 220 Atmospheric Science to better understand Earth’s climate system. We will explore past climate, how we know what that climate was like, and how and why we believe it has changed. We will then examine current evidence for climate change (sea level rise, loss of glacier mass, changes in weather systems) and critique various climate models. Once the class has a good understanding of the science behind climate change we will examine potential impacts in various parts of the world. Finally we will examine climate policy in the US at the federal, state and local level and in various parts of the world."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":309,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.03,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":107,"upperBound":114},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":105,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.47,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8.5,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":145,"upperBound":160}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":155,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.11,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":99,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":65,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.44,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":150,"upperBound":160}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/06-yale-university/","name":"Yale University","available":true,"location":"United States of America","academicPeriod":{"start":"May 27, 2024","end":"August 09, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":7,"toefl":100,"det":120,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"World Cinema","description":"What is a ‘world’, and what is ‘world cinema’? The course poses these questions from diverse angles and emphasizes watching films from many traditions, places, and periods, in order to become articulate, reflexive, and voracious cinephiles well beyond the context of this class. Students study the history of filmmaking across the globe, with a heavy focus on films made beyond the global North-West, considering how films are made and distributed, who pays for them, and how they find local as well as global audiences.

By bringing together topics often approached separately — immigration, education, race, colonialism, and the history of U.S. empire — we will interrogate the ways that education has been mobilized to deploy power: controlling knowledge, categorizing and policing difference, administering unequal paths to citizenship/belonging, forcing assimilation, promoting socio-economic divides, and asserting discipline and control. Topics to be covered include American Indian education and self-determination, African American education in slavery and freedom, U.S. colonial education in the Philippines/Cuba/Puerto Rico, immigration and forced Americanization schooling, Latinx fights for educational access and autonomy, State Department experiments in educational diplomacy and child socialization, educational missions abroad, and national security and the war on terror.

Today multiracial people in the US and other nations are gaining more visibility and recognition. With this visibility, however, comes inevitable scrutiny and ambivalence as evidenced by debates over the identity choices of high-profile multiracial people and the broader social and political implications of a growing social group. This course introduces students to contemporary discussions, debates and narratives surrounding multiracial people. By reading and discussing scholarly, literary, editorial, and visual texts, students critically examine the spaces multiracial people occupy in the U.S. and in other global contexts and explore the identity politics and perspectives that mark these experiences. Students also explore the growing narratives and spaces being created to build communities and express multi-subjectivities. Through class discussions, writing reflections, and a final project, students are encouraged to explore their own identities and subjectivities as they relate to larger discourses, current events, and narratives around race and intersecting identities."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2023":{"RA":{"amount":83,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.07,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":104,"upperBound":108},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":95,"upperBound":150}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.3,"upperBound":3.96},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":108,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":130,"upperBound":150}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/29-penn-state-university","name":"Penn State University","available":true,"location":"United States of America","academicPeriod":{"start":"August 26, 2024","end":"December 13, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":80,"det":120,"regular":false},"courses":[{"title":"Introductory Sociology","description":"SOC 1 provides perspectives and information useful in understanding all societies. The major theories (functionalism, conflict, and symbolic interactionism) and concepts provide the foundation upon which the course material rests. Students will learn how sociologists do research and explore tools for understanding the production of knowledge and for evaluating the validity of sociological assertions. Students will employ critical reasoning skills as they explore the nature and reality of culture and social structure, the formation of the social self and the salience of group identities and norms, social stratification and inequality (in the specific contexts of race, ethnicity, gender, and age), and the complexity of human social life and behavior. Sections of this course may include group research projects, debates, and library or internet-based research.

SOC 119 has three objectives. The course will introduce students to new ways of thinking about race, ethnicity and culture from the perspectives of the social sciences and humanities. Students will be able to compare and contrast differences between race, ethnicity and culture. They will be able to understand the extent and pervasiveness of racial, ethnic and cultural inequality and discrimination in the U.S. and explain how unequal systems impact different ancestry groups. Students will be able to compare historical causes and consequences of sociological processes such as immigration, assimilation and multiculturalism, and they will develop new ways of understanding how these processes are expressed in popular culture (e.g., art, music, literature) and intergroup dynamics. Students will also learn the intellectual tools for having more thoughtful conversations about the issues address in the class. By acquiring these tools, students will be able to formulate more thoughtful questions and responses when they engage others in everyday discussions about the many racial, ethnic and cultural factors and forces that pull people and groups together and push them apart. Finally, students will be able to more clearly explain how their identity reflects and shapes their life experiences as well as others in their racial and ethnic group(s)."},{"title":"Introduction to Art","description":"ARTH 100 provides an introduction to the history of art from prehistory to the present, through selected topics, rather than a comprehensive survey. Areas covered usually include prehistoric art, art of the Near East and Egypt, ancient Greek and Roman art, medieval art culminating with the Gothic, Renaissance art both in Italy and northern Europe, Baroque and Rococo art, and modern developments often highlighting Romanticism, Impressionism, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop, Feminist, and contemporary art. The course also introduces selected artistic traditions in Africa, Asia and the Americas. The course is designed to meet two principal goals. The first is to increase students’ powers of visual analysis and to help them build a critical vocabulary for discussing an art object’s medium, composition, style, and iconography. The second is to foster an understanding of the deep implication of the visual arts in their social and cultural contexts, both historical and contemporary. The course therefore involves significant material relating to political, economic and religious issues. It investigates problems in patronage, function, reception and censorship. It considers such intra- and cross-cultural issues as representations of gender and the incorporation of non-European art forms into the Western tradition. Requirements typically include examinations combining short answer and essay questions, and one paper based library research or intensive examination of an actual work of art"},{"title":"Anthropology, Ancestry, and You","description":"Anthropology, Ancestry, and You will integrate anthropology and genetics through the exploration of the students’ own genealogies and genomic ancestries.

Descriptions will build upon the basic physics of gravity, light, and atoms, and will be discussed in the context of the process of science as a robust and self-correcting way of learning and knowing that relies on making and testing predictions by gathering evidence."},{"title":"Environmental Science","description":"We are living in extraordinary times. Our numbers have now become so large, our power so great, and our consumption so rampant that we are despoiling our home. Indeed, over the past half-century environmental scientists have been calling attention to the deterioration of Earth’s atmosphere, Earth’s oceans, Earth’s forests and Earth’s soils, along with the loss of Earth’s biodiversity, from the tropics to the poles. The evidence is unequivocal: Planet Earth is under duress. Though we need Earth for our survival, Earth does not need us! So, will Earth shake us into oblivion or will we wake up, before it is too late, and become respectful members of Earth’s community of life? This is a critical question for humankind as a whole; and it is the reason that BISC 3 exists at Penn State. So it is that, in this course, we will explore the root causes of today’s environmental crisis and, in so doing, consider scientific, technological, sociological, psychological and personal responses to what is, arguable, the most significant crisis in the history of our species. If you commit to fully engaging with this course, you can expect to: 1-Discover how questions can be powerful catalysts for learning; 2-Grow in your ability to see both yourself and Planet Earth from new and liberating perspectives; 3-Appreciate the power of critical thinking and personal reflection as a means to both personal and global transformation 4-Realize that you, should you choose, can play a significant role in the healing of our world."},{"title":"Introduction to Spreadsheets and Databases","description":"Design, use, and programming of spreadsheets and data bases with applications from a range of disciplines."},{"title":"General View of Mathematics","description":"This course presents a general view of a number of mathematical topics to a non-technical audience, often relating the mathematical topics to a historical context, and providing students with an opportunity to engage with the mathematics at an introductory level. Although some variation in topics covered may take place among different instructors at different campuses, an example of such a course focuses on a number theory theme throughout the course, beginning with the Greeks’ view of integers, the concept of divisors, the calculation of greatest common divisors (which originates with Euclid), the significance of the prime numbers, the infinitude of the set of prime numbers (also known to the ancient Greeks), work on perfect numbers (which continues to be a topic of research today), and the work of Pythagoras and his famous Theorem. The course then transitions to the work of European mathematicians such as Euler and Gauss, including work on sums of two squares (which generalizes the Pythagorean Theorem), and then considering Euler’s phi function, congruences, and applications to cryptography."},{"title":"Classical Mythology","description":"CAMS 45 introduces the myths of ancient Greece and Rome as they are represented in the canonical works of Greek and Latin literature and art.

They spend up to three hours more per day cooking and cleaning than men do, and anywhere from two to ten hours more per day looking after children and the elderly. Women’s underpaid work at home and in industry subsidized the early stages of industrialization in nineteenth-century Britain, early twentieth-century Japan, and contemporary China, and women’s unpaid contributions to their households enable employers worldwide to keep wages low. We know, at least in outline, how women came to carry double burdens in Europe and North America, but little research has been done so far about this process in East Asia. In this course, we will discuss when and how China, Japan, and Korea developed a division of labor in which most wage work was gendered male and reproductive work was marked female. This course will discuss about current divisions of labor between men and women rooted in local cultures, or are they the result of industrial capitalist development. Moreover, about how do divisions of labor differ between the three East Asian countries, and how did developments in one East Asian country affect others."},{"title":"Nuclear Policy","description":"While issues arising from technologies that have both military and civilian applications are not new, the nearly incomprehensible destruction from exploding nuclear weapons focuses the mind as few other dual-use technologies can. This course will examine the development of national policies and the international regimes on the uses of nuclear energy. We will review military doctrine and the plans for nuclear war-fighting as well as the effects on societies of developing and using nuclear weapons. We will review the history of international proliferation of nuclear technology and fissile material and examine efforts to curtail the spread of weapons. In the second part of the course, we will focus on the development of civilian nuclear power and on current policy to prevent accidents and dispose of nuclear waste materials. Political leaders often face policy dilemmas because nuclear technology and materials offer great benefit, as well as presenting great danger. We will explore these dilemmas throughout the course."},{"title":"American Grand Strategy","description":"This course examines the evolution of American grand strategy since 1900, when the United States first emerged on the world stage as a great power. The focus will be on assessing how its leaders have thought over time about: 1) which areas of the world are worth fighting and dying for, 2) when it is necessary to fight in those strategically important areas, and 3) what kinds of military forces are needed for deterrence and warfighting in those regions."},{"title":"Postcolonial and Decolonial History","description":"This course introduces students to some key texts in post and decolonial theory. Our goals in this class are three-fold. First, to familiarize students with foundational thinkers who have inspired both decolonial and postcolonial work. We draw attention to the different ways in which their ideas have been deployed in subsequent post and decolonial scholarship. Second, we ask questions oriented towards comparison of postcolonial and decolonial approaches: What, if any, are the points of overlap between decolonial and postcolonial thought? How do both bodies of work critique and contest the legacies of empire? Third, we investigate the present and possible futures of decolonial and postcolonial thought."},{"title":"Death & Dying","description":"Death is a universal human experience relevant to all areas of social work practice. Through readings, films, discussions and exercises, students will develop an understanding of the dying experience, as well as the attitudes toward and the approach to death and dying in America. The medical system’s influence on end of life care and the rise of hospice and palliative care will be a focus of this course. The notion of a “good death” and the impact of ethnic, cultural, religious and spiritual influences will be explored, as well as advance care planning and the overarching ethical and moral dilemmas that can arise. While the topics of grief and bereavement are not explicitly covered, time will be devoted to exploring loss across the life course, as well as the impact of violent and sudden deaths on victims and their families. In addition, students will have the opportunity to develop a self-awareness of their own values and beliefs toward dying and death, and explore strategies for self-care."},{"title":"Cultural Psychology","description":"There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of “normal” psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of “culture” and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning."},{"title":"Building the New Venture","description":"This course is intended for students who are interested in starting new entrepreneurial businesses. It is tactical, hands-on, and covers the nuts and bolts of starting a company with a lesser emphasis on investing in entrepreneurial ventures. Students will learn how to raise seed funding, compensate for limited human and financial resources, establish brand values and positioning, secure a strong niche position, determine appropriate sourcing and sales channels, and develop execution plans in sales, marketing, product development and operations. The emphasis is managerial and entrepreneurial, essentially a working model for starting an enterprise. This class is executed through a combination of lectures, group assignments based on student’s new venture ideas, case discussions, VC and entrepreneur guest lectures and panels, and ultimately ties together in a pitch at the end of the quarter to a panel of VC observers."},{"title":"Topics in Behavioral Economics","description":"Behavioral economics applies psychological insights to economic markets and decision making. In this class, we will discuss the recent theoretical and empirical advances that have been made in this increasingly important field of economics. Being thoughtful about the role of psychology can lead to a greater understanding of how the economy works."},{"title":"Managing in Organizations","description":"Successfully managing other people – be they competitors or co-workers – requires an understanding of their thoughts, feelings, attitudes, motivations, and determinants of behavior. Developing an accurate understanding of these factors, however, can be difficult to achieve because intuitions are often misguided and unstructured experience can be a poor teacher. This course is intended to address this development by providing the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical for successfully managing others, and also for successfully managing ourselves."},{"title":"International Corporate Finance","description":""},{"title":"Experimental Economics","description":"This course provides the necessary tools to be an avid consumer of the experimental literature and instructs students on how to become a producer of that literature. Topics include a summary of recent experimental findings and details on how to gather and analyze data using experimental methods."},{"title":"Insurgency, Terrorism, and Civil War","description":"This course introduces students to modern, social scientific approaches to the study of political violence. We will focus on several key questions: What are the causes of political violence? How is violence used? Who participates in political violence? What do we know about how to counter the use of violence? How are rebel groups organized? And what are the consequences of violence for society? As we address these questions, we will aim to meet three interrelated goals. First, students will come away from the course with a better sense of the social mechanisms underlying these critical phenomena and a more nuanced understanding of the policy challenges that political violence poses. Second, students will develop an appreciation for how difficult these questions are to answer. Finally, the course is designed to help students think critically about what we learn from the evidence, so that they can engage the relevant policy debates in a serious-minded and informed way."},{"title":"Psychoactive drugs, the Brain and Behavior","description":"The goal of this course is for the students to understand how psychoactive drugs affect the brain and behavior. Understanding how these drugs work will provide students a window in the relationship between the brain and behavior. Understanding how drugs affect the brain and behavior will also enhance the students understanding of the relationship between psychoactive drugs/medications and society."},{"title":"Introduction to Film Analysis","description":"This course introduces basic concepts of film analysis, which students will discuss through examples from different national cinemas, genres, and directorial oeuvres. We will consider film as an art form, medium, and industry, and cover all the major film types: silent, classical, and contemporary narrative cinema, art cinema, animation, documentary, and experimental film. We will study the cinematic techniques: mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound, and learn how filmmakers design their works. Films discussed will include works Orson Welles, Sergei Eisenstein, Shirin Neshat, Lucrecia Martel, and Wong Kar Wai."},{"title":"Environmental Justice in Principle and Practice","description":"Students will learn about different types of environmental injustice and how they intersect with other social problems, including segregation, housing, the devaluing of the lives of people of color, and the geographic distribution of environmental ills. Speakers from communities how have experienced environmental injustices in Chicago will be invited to share their perspectives with students in order to supplement readings from a diverse set of sources and outlooks."},{"title":"Justice and the Economy","description":"This course will explore how contemporary political philosophy conceptualizes the economy, frames the question of economic justice and injustice, and provides a normative case for and against ways of organizing economic institutions. By focusing on a set of specific issues including the justification of property rights, the moral and institutional demands of economic justice, freedom and domination within the labor market, the normative status of corporations, capitalism as a form of structural injustice, and the possibility (or lack thereof) of just financial markets, the seminar will offer a chance to read both classical authors in contemporary political philosophy, including John Rawls, Iris Young, Elizabeth Anderson, and Robert Nozick, as well as more recent and less known literature on the subject. A focus on economic justice will also provide an opportunity to discuss how contemporary political philosophy is either indebted or oblivious to a series of theoretical frameworks traditionally used to approach questions of economic justice, including classical liberalism, republicanism, utilitarianism, Marxism, critical theory, and utopian thought."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2023":{"RA":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.12,"upperBound":3.97},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":5,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.81,"upperBound":3.97},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/21-university-of-texas-at-austin/","name":"University of Texas at Austin","available":true,"location":"United States of America","academicPeriod":{"start":"August 26, 2024","end":"December 13, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":79,"det":"Not Accepted","regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"10-WOMEN AND SOCL MVMNTS IN US","description":"A study of America through its geography, language, government, or cultures.

Explores why nearly half of the world’s languages are facing extinction over the current century, discusses the issues related to that projection, and introduces approaches to maintaining and revitalizing endangered languages."},{"title":"Inventing an Information Society","description":"Provides an introduction to the role computing and information technologies played in political public life, from tabulating machines used to calculate the census to Big Tech’s impact on democratic procedures, the future of labor, and the environment. Though organized around four thematic units (Recognizing and Representing, Knowing, Working, and Belonging), the course pays attention to the chronological trajectory of technologies and political practices and students will develop the skills necessary for historical analysis. While focusing on the US experience the course also highlights the international flow of labor, materials, and ideas. By studying the development of computing historically, we will grapple with the effects of computing and data sciences on society today, paying special attention to critiques of economic, racial, and gender injustice. The course will meet twice a week, and each meeting will include a lecture followed by a discussion."},{"title":"Language and Technology","description":"Examines how new communication technologies affect the way we produce and understand language and modify interaction with one another. Focuses on the collaborative nature of language use and how Internet technologies affect the joint activities of speakers and listeners during the construction of meaning in conversation"},{"title":"Laughter","description":"What makes us laugh, and what doesn’t? How does laughter vary from person to person, place to place, and across time? What work does laughter perform? Is it contagious? What does it mean to have (or lack) a sense of humor? What is laughter’s relationship to pleasure and pain, health and wellness? In this course, we will experiment with the art of “making funny.” Students will explore the science and psychology of humor, construct laughter through language and the body, analyze jokes (to learn how to tell them), and investigate the role of humor in a democratic society."},{"title":"Making a Difference by Design","description":"This course focuses on how leaders in a variety of fields use design as a social change agent. It interweaves theories of leadership and creative problem-solving through case study examinations of a wide range of design innovations in technology, communication, business, education, medicine, human development and ecology. Students learn how design affects their daily lives from the person to the planet. Additional topics include nurturing creativity, visual communications, values-led entrepreneurship, and designing across cultures. Outcome 1: Demonstrates a basic understanding of creative design process – information gathering, idea exploration, iterative feedback loops, prototyping and testing – and an awareness of key factors affecting creativity and teamwork (innovate in research, design or practice). Outcome 2: Recognize design as both a leadership and strategic business planning tool with both tangible and intangible outcomes and impacts across a variety of stakeholders (apply multi-disciplinary perspective). Outcome 3: Understand the concept of whole systems designing as an integrative system of leverage points, decision-making and impact (critical thinking)."},{"title":"Making Sense of World Politics","description":"An introduction to the basic concepts and practice of international politics with an emphasis on learning critical thinking. The course is divided into two parts. In the first half, we will learn about different explanations. In the second half, we will apply these explanations to a set of international events. (IR)"},{"title":"Mathematical Modeling","description":"Introduction to the theory and practice of mathematical modeling. This course compares and contrasts different types of mathematical models (discrete vs. continuous, deterministic vs. stochastic), focusing on advantages, disadvantages and limits of applicability for each approach. Case-study format covers a variety of application areas including economics, physics, sociology, traffic engineering, urban planning, robotics, and resource management. Students learn how to implement mathematical models on the computer and how to interpret/describe the results of their computational experiments."},{"title":"Migration: Histories, Controversies, and Perspectives","description":"This introductory course introduces students to issues and debates related to international migration and will provide an interdisciplinary foundation to understanding the factors that shape migration flows and migrant experiences. We will start by reviewing theories of the state and historical examples of immigrant racialization and exclusion in the United States and beyond. We will critically examine the notions of borders, citizenship/non-citizenship, and the creation of diasporas. Students will also hear a range of perspectives by exposing them to Cornell guest faculty who do research and teach on migration across different disciplines and methodologies and in different world areas. Examples include demographic researchers concerned with immigrant inequality and family formation, geographic perspectives on the changing landscapes of immigrant metropolises, legal scholarship on the rights of immigrant workers, and the study of immigrant culture from a feminist studies lens."},{"title":"Money, Work, and Power","description":"This course will explore key topics in the critical study of labor and capitalism through the lens of food. Questions of race, gender,and class, but also toxicity, settler colonialism, as well as production and reproduction can all be read in the landscapes of food provision and procurement. Food is the ground for an array of labor processes—planting, harvesting, transporting, serving,and eating, just to name a few. Some of these forms of work are overt (stooped workers toiling in pesticide ridden field, for example). But some of these forms of work are invisible and unpaid. And sometimes, they are incredibly well remunerated but totally shadowy. By studying these different forms of work comparatively, we can understand genealogies and futures of inequality, resource use, and the nature of work itself. As this is a writing seminar, we will think not only about how to write but also about the effects of writing in the world. We will think about genre and representation, particularly as writing on food shapes the lives of the often racialized and sexualized workerswho bring food into being. https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/ILRIC/2385"},{"title":"Nature-Culture: Ethnographic","description":"One of the most pressing questions of our time is how we should understand the relationship between nature (or “the environment”) and culture (or society) – and/or whether these should be viewed as separate domains at all. How one answers this question has important implications for how we go about thinking and acting in such diverse social arenas as environmental politics, development, and indigenous-state relations. This course serves as an introduction to the various ways anthropologists and other scholars have conceptualized the relationship between humans and the environment and considers the material and political consequences that flow from these conceptualizations."},{"title":"Statistical Theory and Application in the Real World","description":"Introductory statistics course discussing techniques for analyzing data occurring in the real world and the mathematical and philosophical justification for these techniques. Topics include population and sample distributions, central limit theorem, statistical theories of point estimation, confidence intervals, testing hypotheses, the linear model, and the least squares estimator. The course concludes with a discussion of tests and estimates for regression and analysis of variance (if time permits). The computer is used to demonstrate some aspects of the theory, such as sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem. In the lab portion of the course, students learn and use computer-based methods for implementing the statistical methodology presented in the lectures."},{"title":"Stress and Coping","description":"We will encounter stress in life, whether from the decisions we make, the relationships we pursue, or the society in which we live. Stress has a significant impact on our cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal functioning. This seminar provides an in-depth understanding of the theoretical and empirical work related to the ways in which stress affects the mind and body, and effective strategies for coping with everyday stress. We will cover a variety of topics related to negative life events, psychological stress, physiological stress, coping, and resilience. These topics will be considered from social, personality, developmental, cognitive, and biological perspectives."},{"title":"The Arts of Southeast Asia","description":"The arts of Southeast Asia are studied in their social context, since in traditional societies creative processes are often mapped on the sequence of events that compose human lives. We will be looking particularly at the gendered ways in which bodies are mapped on the land, and how these various framings are often reflected in the unique relationships that emerge between works of art and textual sources. The South Asian epics of the Ramayana (Story of Rama) and the Mahabharata will be explored during the semester as infinitely renewable sources of inspiration."},{"title":"Thinking from a Different Place: Indigenous Philosophies","description":"The Western nation-state has failed to solve the two most pressing, indeed catastrophic, global problems: poverty and climate change. This failure is due to the inability of national policy to imagine a world beyond a boundary drawn by the formative capitalist ideas of property, production, and profit. The course will begin by discussing the historical origin and continuing force of these ideas while raising questions about their limits. Then it will look at a range of alternative ideas about how the world should work if we want to keep it socially, economically, and ecologically in balance. The alternatives we will query come from a range of Indigenous writers of fiction, poetry, and theory, who locate themselves in Native American (north and south), Aboriginal, and Maori communities. https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&coid=496331"},{"title":"Cages and Creativity: Arts in Incarceration","description":"This course explores the increasing presence of all the arts in prisons throughout the country and examines the increasing scholarship surrounding arts programs and their efficacy for incarcerated persons. The course uses video’s, archival material, reading material and in-person or Zoom interviews to investigate how and why art is taught in prisons. The course will also look at art produced by incarcerated artists as well as art by those who are still practicing after going home. And finally, the course will explore the increasing scholarship around the impact practicing the arts while incarcerated has on recidivism rates and preparation for re-entry."},{"title":"Climate Change and Global Development","description":"This course investigates social, political, and economic life in the age of the “Anthropocene”: the current geological era in which humans have irrevocably altered the earth’s biophysical systems. We analyze what political-economic dynamics have led to this, how climate change is known and predicted scientifically, and the impacts it has on politics, economies, environments, and societies across scales. Drawing on case studies from around the world, we investigate topics including climate change impacts on land, oceans, animals, and forests; climate migrants and political instability; (un)natural disasters such as fires, floods, and hurricanes; and sea level rise and cities. We also investigate existing and potential political and economic responses to climate change ranging from international governance agreements and green markets to local climate justice movements."},{"title":"Controversies About Inequality","description":"In recent years, poverty and inequality have become increasingly common topics of public debate, as academics, journalists, and politicians attempt to come to terms with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related units, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate."},{"title":"Critical Reading and Thinking","description":"Enables students to increase critical reading and thinking abilities. Examines theory and research associated with a wide range of reading, thinking, and learning skills. Emphasis is placed on developing and applying analytical and evaluative skills."},{"title":"Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues","description":"This course will introduce students to the meaning and significance of forms of cultural diversity for the understanding of contemporary issues. Drawing from films, videos, and selected readings, students will be confronted with different representational forms that portray cultures in various parts of the world, and they will be asked to examine critically their own prejudices as they influence the perception and evaluation of cultural differences. We shall approach cultures holistically, assuming the inseparability of economies, kinship, religion, and politics, as well as interconnections and dependencies between world areas such as Africa, Latin America, the West. Among the issues considered: political correctness and truth; nativism and ecological diversity; race, ethnicity, and sexuality; sin, religion, and war; global process and cultural integrity. Students are additionally required to interact on discussion board outside published class time and view asynchronous course lectures. Will accommodate time zone difference to ensure participation does not extend beyond 10pm in their local time."},{"title":"Culture and Mental Health: Anthropological Perspectives","description":"Global Mental Health is a growing and important field within the general category of Global Public Health. Anthropology has an established and long history of contributing to the debates about cross-cultural psychiatry and psychotherapy, as well as to the perennial questions of nature versus nurture in defining normal versus pathological ways of being human. Cross-cultural explanations for varied and/or universal forms of human subjectivity, affect, and personality are increasingly relevant given new research into neurological plasticity, genomics, and the dissemination and practice of evidence-based and pharmaceutically-oriented psychiatry at the expense of more holistic and culturally nuanced forms of care. We examine the efficacy of traditional and community-based mental health practices in non-Western contexts as well as the challenges to accessibile care posed by inequality and precarity, as well as the stigmas surrounding mental illness in varied cultural contexts."},{"title":"Design and Innovation","description":"This course introduces students to a design toolkit and mindset for creative problem solving that enables a shift from a 20th century, market-based perspective to a more sustainable, human-centered approach appropriate to this century’s systemic challenges. Topics covered include: opportunity finding and innovation; the design thinking cycle of inspiration-interpretation-ideation-implementation; and visual communication. Students will learn to apply design strategies to their work to make it more integrated and collaborative. This course will require openness to new ways of (divergent) thinking."},{"title":"Digital History of Black Resistance","description":"This course will use digital resources to study the history of African-American resistance to and organization against slavery, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration/racialized policing from 1619 to the present. We will also build new resources. In addition to the historical content, students will participate in designing, building, and testing digital humanities resources that are reshaping how we understand the past and the present."},{"title":"Dress Cloth and Identity","description":"This course uses a multi-disciplinary approach to examine the importance of textiles in African social and economic history. It combines art history, anthropology, social and economic history to explore the role of textiles in marking status, gender, political authority and ethnicity. In addition, we examine the production and distribution of indigenous cloth and the consequences of colonial rule on African textile industries. Our analysis also considers the principles of African dress and clothing that shaped the African diaspora in the Americas as well as the more recent popularity and use of African fabrics and dress in the United States."},{"title":"Ethics in New Media, Technology, and Communication","description":"This course examines moral and ethical issues in communication, new media, and technology. Using theories and research in moral philosophy and psychology, we examine how people perceive and reason about ethical issues presented by media and technology, and how moral action is influenced by cognitive, emotional, and ethical belief systems. Issues of autonomy, transparency, harm, privacy, manipulation, justice, democracy, equality, and care are discussed. We analyze the consistency between personal and professional ethics, the importance of moral character and agency, and the translation of moral thought to ethical action, and address the development of professional and personal ethical codes of conduct and research for communication professionals in the areas of new media and technology. Outcome 1: Students will be able to increase awareness of moral and ethical issues in media, technology, and communication. Outcome 2: Students will be able to explain moral psychology and ethical principles. Outcome 3: Students will be able to examine moral reasoning and ethical responsibilities—both personal and professional—that affect people and society.

Examples from biology and the social sciences are used"},{"title":"Foreign Policy as Subversion","description":"To what extent does the ideal of the US as a vanguard for democracy and freedom in the world match up with other aspects—military, economic, and humanitarian—of US foreign policy? This same question about the degree to which discourses and practices correspond might be asked of other countries, like the Soviet Union, China, and Britain, but this course examines the ways in which US foreign policy has been deployed over the course of the twentieth century and the ways those policies have been perceived and received by people living in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Particular case studies will be addressed stemming from the faculty’s specializations (for example, Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Chile) and the emphasis is on the role of the United States in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Prominent themes will include forms of subversion, from military muscle to economic coercion, and how and why they have changed over time; meanings of liberty, democracy, freedom, and sovereignty in different places and times; popular responses to policies and actions of foreign administrations; the relationships between sovereign states and transnational corporations; the uses and abuses of History in the formulation and justification of policy initiatives and in local responses to them; and the complexities involved in discerning internal and external forces in an increasingly transnational world."},{"title":"Free Speech, Censorship, and the Age of Global Media","description":"This course will help us understand how our ideas about free speech are shifting in an age of global information by surveying the history of censorship from the late 16th-century to the present day. In democratic societies, freedom of expression is both a cultural value and protected right, and yet governments also routinely regulate speech through a variety of mechanisms: from direct censorship, to licensing and copyright laws, to high court decisions about what qualifies as “speech”. We will consider how the categories of dangerous speech—blasphemy, pornography, treason, libel—and thresholds of toleration, have changed over time. And we will also consider forms of censorship that have sought to protect freedoms and ensure civil discourse, such as restrictions on hate speech, genocide denial, and “fake news”. Authors and subjects may include Milton, Defoe, Freud, Foucault, Joyce, MacKinnon, Butler, Wiki-Leaks, campus speech debates, Anonymous, social media, net neutrality and the economic determinants of free speech."},{"title":"Global Food, Water and Energy Nexus","description":"This course is offered by four Departments at Cornell, in collaboration with two Universities in China and one India. Video conferencing will be used to connect classrooms in the three countries in real time. Important issues related to the food, energy, and water nexus and its implications for nutrition security, one health, environmental sustainability, and economic development the US and these two countries will be described. Challenges associated with these issues will be evaluated and strategies to address them will be proposed. Engagement of these countries with each other and the rest of the world will be explored. The course serves as a platform for students from Cornell, China, and India to learn from and interact with each other in the same class, and to share their thinking, creativity, and perspectives on these issues."},{"title":"Health, Poverty and Inequality: A Global Perspective","description":"Course focuses on global health challenges, and how they are related to poverty and inequality. Outcome 1: Understand the nature and extent of global health challenges and inequalities in health at various levels, including across countries, at the national level, and even within the household, both current and historical. Outcome 2: Understand possible policy responses to improving health and well-being and reducing observed disparities, differentiating the appropriate role of government and the private sector in crafting solutions to global health programs, including priority setting and resource allocation. Outcome 3: Prepare convincing and policy relevant documents that outline major global health challenges, including their causes, magnitude (prevalence and incidence), and feasible opportunities to address these problems, taking into account the political and economic dimensions, as well as considerations such as the time frame, and positive and negative externalities, both anticipated and unanticipated."}],"intakeStatistics":{}}],"Asia":[{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/s88-national-taiwan-normal-university/","name":"National Taiwan Normal University","available":true,"location":"Taiwan","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 09, 2024","end":"December 22, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":80,"det":120,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Classical Music","description":"This course provides an introductory survey of the Western classical music.

We interrogate what ‘selfhood’ means to a range of established and emerging Asian writers, asking how and why they construct gender and ethnic identities in their works, and what insights this provides into the Asian psyche. We begin by investigating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a ‘woman’ or a ‘man’ here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of ‘racial’ difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West and South Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia. By the end of this literary odyssey, students will have gained a wide-ranging appreciation of how modern Asian writers envision gender and ethnicity, and contemplated the relevance of these fictive visions to their own sense of selfhood as young adults living in Asia."},{"title":"AI and Humanity","description":"“Technology (specifically AI) has evolved beyond a technical proposition to a shaping force of our future, interwoven into social, cultural and political elements of human society."},{"title":"Sustainability Reporting","description":"Sustainability reporting is the practice of disclosing an organization’s economic, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and impacts.

The original idea of pattern languages was proposed by architect Christopher Alexander. The late 1970’s book he wrote with his colleagues contained 253 patterns on practical architectural design. In the context of architecture, the pattern language was developed in order to serve a lingua franca for designing buildings between architects and residents. Alexander anticipated that people could get involved in the designing process of their homes and towns. Ten years after the book was published, Alexander’s idea of pattern languages was adopted in the field of software design. Since the 2000’s, the fields in which pattern languages are applied have shown even more expansion to cover creative human actions such as education, learning, presentation, collaboration, social innovation, policy making, disaster prevention, life design and even beauty in daily life. Pattern languages are now used to connect all kinds of people with all kinds of different experiences. The patterns help bring light to the less noticeable parts of a person’s experience, so the person can reconsider the experience to talk about it and share it with others. In the classes, you will learn the concept and cases of pattern language"},{"title":"Introduction to Fluid Mechanics","description":"This course is an introduction to fluid mechanics, which deals with the motion of fluid (such as water and air) and objects and their interaction.

Instead, it matters much more to ensure that science is taken seriously. Advances in technology typically outpace the public’s version of the underlying science, leading to public distrust and confusion about the actual benefits and risks involved. Popular culture, particularly movies, often misrepresent scientific facts for entertainment and is usually viewed as part of the problem. However, some films offer excellent opportunities for teachers to draw connections and parallels between entertaining movie science and exciting real-world science. This course was designed for non-biology majors to show how biology themes were used to teach essential ideas. For example, whether DNA is sufficient to create life, how life evolves, what cloning is, and how bionics could improve/impact our future life. Students will additionally explore public misconceptions and naiveté about science perpetuated by movies, as well as the extent to which such films borrow from or, in some cases, even predict scientific facts. This course requires bi-weekly screenings of a feature-length movie before the lectures in the classroom. Films and topics are organized around biological themes. Discussion of films that feature different biological transformations will focus on three aspects—first, distinguishing between science fiction and science fact.

The current investigation of the ancient history must also be replaced into this larger framework of research, which puts the material culture and archaeological context on the same footing as the texts themselves. The sciences of the Antiquity comprise the classical philology (of which the main tasks are the study of the textual transmission and the establishment of texts), historical linguistics, palaeolography, rhetoric, epigraphy, papyrology, onomastics, chronology and calendars, numismatics, ceramology, field archaeology and iconography. However, as the classical philology remains the foundation of the Altertumswissenschaften and the knowledge of languages constitutes the very basis of philology, the present course aims at teaching ancient Greek and introducing to the history of the texts. Selective explorations into other branches of the sciences of the Antiquity will serve as learning auxiliaries. This course can hopefully also help students better understand, from its roots, the Western civilization from the Renaissance to the present day."},{"title":"Exploring Taiwan: natural environment and resources","description":"Taiwan, an island country rich in biodiversity, located between Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea Plate, the geological structure is quite young. The frequent orogeny in Taiwan form many towering mountains, so even though Taiwan is in the tropical and subtropical zone, the temperate climate can still be found at high altitudes. In addition, the creatures, adapted to different climates, are able to survive in Taiwan. Taiwan is also known from high percentage of endemic species. This is because in the Ice Age, Taiwan was connected to Eurasia. After the Ice Age, Taiwan was isolated by the ocean, and many lives gradually evolved into endemic species on the island. Nowadays, the proportion of endemic species in Taiwan is about 71% in mammals, 17% in birds, 22% in reptiles, 31% in amphibian, 19% in freshwater fish, 25% in plants, and 60% in insects. Although the land area of Taiwan is only 0.027% of the total of the world, the number of species is as high as 3.8%, which is 150 times the global average. Furthermore, the marine species around Taiwan are about 10% of the world, which is 361 times the average. Taiwan is not a country with large territory, while its rich biological resources are such amazing. Base on that, we invite guest speakers in different fields to talk about the geography, wildlife, ecosystem and culture of Taiwan.

The aim is to provide students with a historical grounding in the main political trends, institutions, personalities, ideas and ideologies."},{"title":"Contemporary Design In Context","description":"Contemporary design is a vibrant field of practice characterised by applied creativity, engagement and collaboration as well as the art and craft of making. Definitions of design practice are being reformulated in response to rapid changes in technology, society and environment; design now moves across a wide range of different media, materials and contexts. In the early decades of the twenty-first century we take stock of contemporary design practice, where it has come from, and where it is going. This course provides a grounding in concepts, practices and issues in contemporary design. Through a combination of practical work, case studies, readings and research, students will develop a critical understanding of design as a discipline in the modern context; its concepts, artefacts, processes and practices. Key themes include functional and aesthetic value; design methods and processes; planning, intention and making; and the social roles and cultural contexts of design."},{"title":"Coping with Crisis: The Practice of International Security","description":"This course is designed to help students to deepen their understanding of key concepts in security studies and then apply them to real world situations.

This is an introductory course in Australian Indigenous Studies that centre First Peoples’ diverse perspectives and that critically engages with scholarly and popular narratives about key events."},{"title":"Foundations of Australian Law","description":"This course must be taken in the commencing semester of a student’s LLB program. Students commencing their legal studies in Semester One are expected to undertake Foundations of Australian Law with LAWS1203 Torts. Students commencing their legal studies in Semester Two are expected to undertake Foundations of Australian Law with LAWS1204 Contracts. This is because the content in the relevant companion course is utilised in various ways in Foundations of Australian Law. Foundations of Australian Law is designed to lay the groundwork for the remainder of students’ legal studies. In particular, the course aims to assist students to develop a range of legal skills that are crucial for successful legal studies and for professional practice. Students learn the essential skills that enable them to engage with and use our principal sources of law – case law and legislation. In addition to teaching students how to analyse case law and legislation and to formulate legal arguments, the course also covers the key legal principles of statutory interpretation and the role of the courts in interpreting statutes. To set the context for these sources of Australian law, the course also seeks to familiarise students with: – some of the fundamental features of the legal institutions that generate laws (the courts and the Parliament); – sources of Australian law in addition to case law and legislation (including the Australian Constitution, customary law and international law); and – the historical and social forces that have shaped and continue to shape the law-making process and the legal system. This course meets the requirements of the Law Admissions Consultative Committee Statement on Statutory Interpretation."},{"title":"Global Citizen: Culture, Development and Inequality","description":"Just how involved are we are on a daily basis with the processes, the politics, the social and economic relations and the other formations that constitute this complex and slightly scary thing called globalisation? Beginning with some of the things that are closest and most familiar to us – including the clothes on our backs – we’re going to start at the ground and trace upwards the links that attach us to far off countries, economies, sites of production and fellow humans. In this way, we will trace our own map of the world system and get some sort of critical understanding of how we slot into it. In the process, we will ask ‘Is there a more ethical way for us to approach some of those core global practices in which we all participate: consumption, tourism, inhabiting the city, and using the internet and social media?’ How, in this immensely complex context, are we to be good global citizens? In the process of doing this we will learn the fundamental concepts anthropologists and other social scientists use to make sense of globalisation’s exciting new cultural and social forms and its not so exciting new forms of exploitation and inequality. The focus will be on understanding the language of the anthropology of globalisation, and the practical and critical application of its key concepts to real life global issues. We will use an innovative team based learning approach in which students help each other workshop the weekly readings and carry out critical and interpretive activities in class based on real life case studies."},{"title":"International Relations in the Asia-Pacific","description":"This course will apply basic international relations theories encompassing realist, liberal-internationalist and constructivist perspectives to ongoing and emerging political dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region. It complements comparative political perspectives on regional governance by applying state-centric and key sub-state based perspectives on understanding how the region ‘matters’ in a global context. Various perspectives on international political economics, foreign policy analysis, international security and regional/international institutions will supplement the theoretical perspectives that underwrite the subject’s conceptual approach."},{"title":"Natural Resource Conflicts in Asia and the Pacific","description":"Violent conflicts over natural resources are an enduring feature of social and political life at different scales and levels of organisation. The inter-state and geopolitical dimensions of conflicts over resources such as oil and water loom large in the popular imaginary. However, resource conflicts in the global South are predominantly fought internally, within the boundaries of the nation-state. Indeed, according to the United Nations, at least 40 percent of internal conflicts globally are related to natural resources. It is these sorts of conflicts that are the focus of this course. A striking conundrum lies at the heart of the inquiry: rather than contributing to peace and prosperity, empirical research demonstrates that natural resource wealth increases the likelihood that a country will experience internal armed conflict. How and why is this the case? What about the role of resource scarcity as driver of violent conflict in developing-country contexts? What sort of policy responses and interventions are available? How might natural resource wealth contribute to peace rather than to conflict? What is the role of political and economic contestation in these struggles over land and natural resources? The course will be structured around a series of case studies drawn from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. A political ecology framework will be applied to the analysis of how land and different types of resource complexes – including mining, oil and gas, forestry, and oil palm – can be implicated in violent conflict. Alongside these case studies, students will undertake their own analysis of a natural resource conflict in which they will be attentive to the role of different actors – especially the state, communities and corporations – and to questions of scale, power and identity. The course will have a very strong research-led approach to teaching and learning. In addition to core expertise housed in SSGM, it draws upon expertise from other parts of the Coral Bell School and the Crawford School. In addition to the involvement of some of these scholars in class room teaching, the assessment for the course will enable students to engage with them in innovative ways."},{"title":"Pacific Politics","description":"The Pacific Islands is a region of diverse political traditions, complex developmental challenges and enduring strategic importance. The close relationship it shares with Australia stems from its geographical, historical and cultural ties, but has been tested by disputes over climate change and the role of China in the region. This course explores contemporary political and developmental issues in the region, including the ongoing legacy of colonialism, decolonisation and secessionist movements; the nature of democracy and how it has been challenged by coups, constitutional crises and rising authoritarianism in the region; and the ways in which Pacific states navigate the international system in an evolving geo-strategic environment."},{"title":"Pacific Worlds: critical inquiry in Oceania","description":"This course introduces students to the Pacific region and to the wealth of Pacific knowledge, resources and institutions at ANU and in Canberra more broadly. Pacific Worlds will be explored in seminar format and in dialogue with selected scholars and policy-makers, and through visits to institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, and National Gallery of Australia. It will provide students with an exciting opportunity to experience the ways in which the Pacific has been crucial to the development and contemporary cultural, scholarly and political priorities of former colonial powers, including Australia. The course will highlight the ways in which Pacific Islanders themselves have responded critically to these uneven relationships and how documentation and collection practices in Australian institutions reflect these political dynamics."},{"title":"Peacebuilding and Conflict Resolution","description":"In the 21st century the need for effective peacebuilding and conflict resolution is as great as ever. Many long-running conflicts remain unresolved. Pessimists even see the menacing potential for new wars looming just over the horizon. What are the conditions for sustainable peace? This course begins by examining the mechanisms available for bringing about peaceful resolutions to conflict and war. We seek to analyse the prospects for peace in the 21st century through a close engagement with examples of conflict resolution and peacebuilding from across the Asia-Pacific region. These case-studies each illustrate different challenges and approaches to conflict resolution and peace building. Students will be encouraged to consider the communication strategies, attitudes towards justice, political instincts and other practical attributes that are relevant to resolving conflict and building peace in such contexts. To facilitate a hands-on appreciation of those attributes, the course includes a hypothetical exercise designed to challenge us to look at peace efforts from a variety of real-world perspectives. The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University’s approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website."},{"title":"Reading Popular Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Studies","description":"An introduction to the field of cultural studies, this unit progresses through a “circuit of culture”. Using this model, it introduces the key concepts and practices of representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Two areas of contemporary culture will be of particular interest to this unit: (1) issues surrounding advertising, corporate power and globalisation, and (2) debates about the representation of gender and sexuality in the media and popular culture. In the first half of the course, students will learn to use semiotics, a method that is widely used by cultural and feminist critics to study how meanings are produced in images and texts. Coupling semiotics with theories of identity, subjectivity, ideology and discourse students will analyse power relationships in popular culture. Students will also become familiar with debates relating to production and consumption. Upon completing the course requirements, students will have experience in applying core methods and theories analytically, and will be able to demonstrate critical reflection on key concepts shared by cultural and gender studies."},{"title":"Sustainable Development","description":"Twenty-five years on from the first call for sustainable development, we are still struggling with fundamental questions surrounding what it is, how we can usefully characterise it and, most importantly, how to actually achieve it. In this course we critically examine the concept of sustainable development, explore its history, and analyse the present-day challenges it presents. Drawing on international case studies in both developed and developing countries, as well as global initiatives, we investigate the goals of sustainability as they relate to environmental, social and economic goals. Students are introduced to a range of viewpoints, theories and frameworks useful for thinking about and understanding social and environmental change in the context of sustainable development. We explore a range of contemporary sustainability issues, at local, national and global scales. Using case studies and problem-based learning, students draw connections and apply concepts and techniques that may help inform practical solutions and shape our collective future."},{"title":"The Origins of Political Order in Asia","description":"This course traces the historical development of Asia’s diverse political systems. It examines underlying geo-political realities and their implications for political structure and focusses on the religious and political systems of thought that have shaped Asian political systems, especially regarding leadership, the family, ethnicity, social class and age. The course commences with the emergence of civilization in Asia, examines political structures as they were influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity, the transformation of ethnic and national identities brought about in the era of western imperialism, and the assertion of new political ideals inspired by communism, liberalism, religions and reinterpretations of the past."},{"title":"The Wellbeing Formula: The Science and Practice of Making a Good Life","description":"The Wellbeing Formula will introduce you to the psychological science and practice of wellbeing. It will draw on psychological theory, research evidence, and practical techniques to help you understand the factors that create flourishing individuals, communities, and societies. Specifically, this course will provide you with an understanding of current theoretical models and research evidence regarding the factors that promote the capacity for people to thrive. Among these factors are developing the ability to: • have a deep sense of self-acceptance, • experience positive emotions, • be fully engaged in life, • have positive relationships with others, • experience a sense of accomplishment, • have a sense that your life is valuable and meaningful, • experience personal growth through life’s difficulties, • have a sense of being in charge of your own life, and • optimise your physical health. In addition to its focus on psychological factors, the course will address sociocultural factors in terms of the societal determinants of wellbeing and how to build flourishing communities and societies. More than helping you to gain an intellectual understanding of the science of wellbeing, this course will also provide instruction in key strategies whereby you can understand the processes involved in enhancing your own wellbeing and that of others. This course will move away from a more traditional focus on illness to one on health, from what causes us to experience distress to what protects us against distress, from a focus on eliminating problems to cultivating strengths, and from how our suffering can be minimised to how we can thrive."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":109,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.12,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":96,"upperBound":108},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":80,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.49,"upperBound":3.96},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":150}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":16,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.36,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":98,"upperBound":100},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":115,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":9,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.36,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":98,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/32-the-university-of-adelaide/","name":"The University of Adelaide","available":true,"location":"Adelaide, Australia","academicPeriod":{"start":"July 22, 2024","end":"November 16, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":79,"det":null,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Asia and the World","description":"Asia’s immense impact on the world over the last 2-3,000 years has often been obscured and is rarely part of Australian common knowledge. Asia and the World provides all students, but especially those doing International Studies and Asian Studies, with a basic introduction to notions of Asia. Many things which are taken for granted as being Western, often have their origins in the East in some way. This influence extends to language, hamburgers, philosophical ideas and ways of illustrating what we see. This influence is not limited to the ancient past. Today Asian pop culture is reshaping Western pop culture and ideas and products from Asia are changing our lives in fundamental ways even if the origins are not obvious. Asia and the World highlights the irony of how reactions to Asia shaped Europe’s destiny and how its inventions and ideas have been adapted by Western states and often used to then dominate Asia in the colonial period. The contemporary rise of independent Asian nation states is reviewed and contextualised and the processes which obscure Asian influence are explained. Your view of why Australian/Western history and culture are the way they are may well change the way you see the world."},{"title":"Australia and the World","description":"This course examines Australian history from 1901 until the present. Australians have variously been described as a nation of sporting champions, yet we lose more often than we win; of ‘battling’ when we live in relative wealth; and of settling in the ‘outback’ while we sprawl into cities. We’ve been characterised as a ‘classless’ society and an equal one, which is at odds with the experience of many women and unemployed people. We’ve been introduced as descendants of convicts and ‘Poms’ when our families are just as likely to have emigrated from Eastern Europe or Asia or lived on this land for thousands of years. Students in this course will learn how each of these descriptions have been evoked for a purpose. They are used by politicians willing to appeal to a particular constituency, and by opponents in debates about federation, immigration, aboriginal rights, welfare, the status of women, and the possibility of Australia becoming a republic. In this course, the trajectory of these debates, which have shaped Australian identity, will be explored in addition to the social effects of the 1930s Depression, the legacy of the Menzies and Whitlam Governments, Australia’s participation in war and its place in the global village. Students will have the opportunity to recall our long-felt deference to Britain, our more recent acceptance of our Aboriginal heritage, our brief flirtation as an Asian nation, and our current ‘coalition’ with the United States, and ponder where our future might lay."},{"title":"Cities and Sustainability","description":"As cities grow and develop their environmental impacts are concentrated locally but have impacts across the globe. Informed by a critical use of urban political ecology, this course focuses on the complex interaction between the social and material processes of urbanisation and environmental change. Students will be introduced to: the way urban development alters soils, water systems and biodiversity; energy and resource flows within and through cities; the contribution of cities to climate change and the impacts of climate change on cities. In the process of exploring these issues, students will be introduced to measures aimed at addressing the environmental impacts of urbanisation and creating more sustainable cities."},{"title":"Cross Cultural Communication","description":"Misunderstandings often arise when speakers of different languages, or indeed speakers of the same language communicate. Some misunderstandings are easily identified and rectified or may be of little consequences. At other times there can be a complete breakdown in communication. Serious miscommunication can even result when neither party is aware that there is any problem. Both parties may think that the other is understanding perfectly what they are saying, though a major misunderstanding is unfolding resulting in misdiagnosis, mistreatment, gross injustice, financial penalty or the like. The course seeks to identify and make explicit sources of misunderstanding through practical investigation of interactions in a range of contexts. It will specifically address the use of interpreters, the role of dialectal differences and different cultural scripts (including subcultures within the same language group). Practical means of identifying and minimising misunderstandings will be promoted. This course will be of interest to a wide range of students, including students of Linguistics, Medicine, Nursing and other health professions, Law, Media, Education, Social Work, languages etc."},{"title":"Cyber-Politics: Politics & the Internet Revolution","description":"The course examines how the digital age has transformed politics around the world. Information and communication technologies have deeply changed both the private and public spheres, the internet has radically changed the way people communicate with each other and interact with the state and private corporations. It has reshaped our economies, and created new opportunities for political engagement and organization. Citizens use the internet to organise protests and boycotts, but the internet is also a space where individuals may become radicalised. It provides a democratised platform for the production and consumption of information, but also lends itself to the proliferation of “fake news”, echo chambers and hate speech. Governments attempt to enact laws that control, censor, or monitor online interactions. But private corporations are similarly interested to control and utilize the internet to gather data on current and future consumers, and to exploit commercial opportunities. Similar opportunities are also sought by criminal actors, who seek to use the internet to pursue criminal, aggressive and terrorist activities. How, then, ought the internet be governed? Who should have authority to control internet access and content? In this course, we will explore this complex web of relations, dangers and opportunities by tackling questions such as: should the internet be censored, and by whom? Should hate speech be prohibited? Who should control access to the internet? Should Facebook be nationalised? What is the value of privacy? What impact is the internet, and particularly social media, having on the human experience? What is cybersecurity and how do we achieve it? Does internet communication favour populist and authoritarian leaders? How do these issues relate to one another and to conceptions of network neutrality more generally?"},{"title":"Empowerment, Gender & Community Development","description":"This course investigates crucial interconnections between empowerment, gender and community development, examining the ways in which gender and community participation, influence development policies, processes and programs; and the extent to which development, gendered relations, and communities are transformed in the process. It examines key concepts and theoretical frameworks of development with a particular focus on the intersection of development terms such as community, participation, sustainability, gender, equality & empowerment, in light of current issues in development discourse and critical analysis of development practice and policy. In the course, then, we explore the use of certain concepts and ideals, such as empowerment, gender equality, sustainable development, as well as central issues in development practice and policy. These include the interaction between poverty and gender; the empowerment of women through work and microfinance/credit; and the proposed empowerment of communities (and countries) through the `girl effect?. The complexities of corporate community development are also examined, as is the practice of tourism (volunteer/cultural) as sustainable community development; the issue of gendered violence, legislation and human rights at the level of local communities; and an analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals from the standpoint of gender and the community."},{"title":"Indigenous Scholarship & Interplay of Knowledges","description":"This course will provide a foundation for students on the history of the affirmation, development and legitimization of Indigenous knowledge, theory and scholarship in Australia and internationally. Contemporary Indigenous knowledge present a counterpoint to colonial and post-colonial knowledge regimes as they are played out through education, politics, law and society among numerous other areas of the modern world. In investigating these knowledge structures students will learn about the diversity of Indigenous cultures in Australia. This will be counterpointed with study of key Indigenous cultures and associated texts in North America, Scandinavia and the Pacific. A focus will be placed on the student’s capacity to apply multi-knowledges and interdisciplinary approaches for both complex understanding and the requirements of working with Indigenous communities. From this base students, will learn about the importance of applying Indigenous cultural protocols in the Australian context and in the presentation of Indigenous perspectives in everyday academic, legal, political and economic work. Students will also learn to re-conceptualise problems and question cultural assumptions by negotiating appropriate methodologies to analyse, evaluate and work independently and cooperatively. A variety of methods will be used to achieve engagement, analysis and synthesis including appropriate use of technologies, film, the analysis of texts and learning from Indigenous Elders and academics."},{"title":"International Business Operations","description":"This course prepares students for working in an organisation that operates internationally. Students are exposed to different aspects that underpin internationalisation decisions of a firm. They also learn about the input of different functional units within organisations in the success of its international operationists. The broad content themes include international strategy and organisation; entrepreneurial nature of international expansion; different modes of foreign market entry; internationalisation of service firm; international marketing, human resource management, and sourcing. Finally, students have an opportunity to explore ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the international context. The course develops skills in analysing cross-border business scenarios, identifying opportunities and risks entailed in various internationalisation decisions, appreciating the complexity of international business operations, and including ethics and social responsibility as significant factors shaping a firm’s behaviour in a home and host country(ies)."},{"title":"Introduction to Marketing","description":"This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the principles of Marketing.

Additionally, the course will provide opportunities for the practical implementation of the concepts covered and the development of problem solving skills by means of face-to-face seminars and tutorials and online learning."},{"title":"Introduction to Social Research","description":"Which youth crime prevention programs work? Is job market situation for university graduates in Australia improving or worsening? Why do some international students succeed in Australian universities, while others experience great difficulties? Are local media in Adelaide focusing more on the street crime than on the corporate crime? What is currently known about factors that lead to a happy and lasting intimate relationship? This course will introduce you to the ways in which social researchers seek to answer such questions. You will learn how to formulate feasible research questions. You will be introduced to a variety of research methods that can be used to answer such questions.

Techniques such as expert systems, machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and machine vision are affecting almost every aspect of modern society. In particular, these techniques are changing the way in which government and business make decisions and the interaction between humans and machines in almost all facets of life. These developments have many beneficial consequences. They also raise a host of concerns, including about the impact of AI on privacy, employment, interpersonal relationships, and human rights. Developing technical, ethical and legal responses to these kinds of technologies, and those have yet to be developed, requires cross disciplinary insights, including from the humanities, science, design, economics, computing, and law. Drawing on these perspectives, and also industry expertise, “AI, Ethics and the Law” explores these issues through a series of case studies, including: surveillance and facial recognition technologies predictive policing and algorithmic sentencing fake news and deep fakes algorithmic decision-making in government and by business for employment, credit and social services AI in medicine, finance and legal law AI in environmental protection and animal welfare service and care robots."},{"title":"Biology of Australian Flora & Fauna","description":"This subject will introduce you to the natural history of Australia from the Cretaceous to the present and the influence of Australia’s First Peoples and Europeans on Australia’s environments.

This subject will require you to observe, record, and reflect on the diversity of the natural world, and complete self-guided field trips with your peers within the Melbourne metropolitan region."},{"title":"Drugs that Shape Society","description":"Drugs that Shape Society is a compelling story of drugs that provides insight to us as individuals and as a society. Drugs impact our lives in many different ways. Social responses to their use have shaped our laws, the health system, commerce – even foreign policies. In Australia the use of therapeutic drugs is carefully regulated to maintain cost and safety, some recreational drugs are taxed heavily to provide government income, while others are banned and huge costs are incurred attempting to prevent their use. Other countries have a different blend of risk, responsibility and regulation. Drugs that Shape Society is a University breadth subject available to all second-year students. Using a case-study approach, students will explore the scientific, social, historical and legal issues associated with alcohol, opiates, tobacco, penicillin and thalidomide. Any drug use carries risk – medical, social, ethical and legal. Who has been, or is, responsible for managing that risk? What is the role of policy and regulation in minimising risk and assigning responsibility? These questions will be explored by consideration of the scientific, ethical and economic factors determining drug development; the addictive nature of certain drugs, the striking contrasts between drug marketing strategies, ranging from illegal dealing to professional multi-facted advertising; and the risks associated with legal and illicit drug use and abuse. Lectures will provide basic information about the processes leading to the development of the drugs, their mechanism of action, the historical context of their impact on society, and how this has been handled legally. Tutorials and small group work will allow students to discuss and debate the issues raised and to put them into the context of their own experiences."},{"title":"Engineering Modelling and Design","description":"The subject will develop your understanding of the engineering modelling and design processes by taking you through the life cycle of a real-world engineering project and using a combination of lectures and hands-on workshop sessions.

Please view this video for further information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypa7eZmbhrM"},{"title":"Entrepreneurship for Sustainability","description":"Entrepreneurship for Sustainability is a project-based subject. Working in teams, learners will propose an entrepreneurial venture to improve Australia’s performance against at least one of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through this subject, learners will be introduced to the SDG framework and its uses, as well as various tools to elicit and validate an entrepreneurial concept. This subject is for anyone interested in learning, through experience, about entrepreneurial approaches to addressing real challenges to create impact and value – not just learners with entrepreneurial ambitions. The subject contains a high degree of industry and community interaction, including guest speakers who have experience addressing SDGs through entrepreneurial means. Learners will be supported to: • integrate their own disciplinary knowledge relating to the problem they choose to tackle • learn from industry speakers to enrich their grasp of the problem • conduct background, user, and expert research to develop a deeper, shared understanding of the problem • identify and assess creative means to address the problem, and • design a proposed solution for impact, considering the social, environmental, and economic inputs, influences and dynamics at play. Learners are not required to come into the subject already having an idea. At the beginning of the semester, learners will be provided with a series of prompts – specific ideas for problem areas they may choose to tackle."},{"title":"Entrepreneurship Principles and Tools","description":"The purpose of this subject is to study topics on entrepreneurship and innovation. The subject closely examines the definition of an entrepreneur as an innovator who recognises and seizes opportunities; converts those opportunities into workable/marketable ideas; adds value through effort, money and skills; assumes the risk of the competitive marketplace to implement these ideas; and realises the rewards from these efforts. This subject presents some of the key frameworks and tools needed by entrepreneurs and is for anyone who has an interest in understanding entrepreneurship, not just potential founders. The subject uses the lens of entrepreneurship to investigate developing areas of knowledge that are relevant to all organisations, from traditional firms to startups, while also recognising that in the future, many students will either start or work for non-traditional organisations."},{"title":"Food For A Healthy Planet II","description":"This interdisciplinary subject recognises and explores the intricate link between food, human health, and the sustainability of our planet. As the world is becoming increasingly urbanised and citizens are becoming more affluent, people are turning towards unhealthy “Western-style” diets characterised by high-energy, nutrient-poor processed and refined foods. This shift in dietary patterns has led to an increased morbidity burden due to obesity and other non-communicable diseases. Thus, there is an urgent need to address diet-related health problems created by under/over-nutrition and poor dietary practices by tackling the underlying scientific, technological, policy, regulatory, cultural, and economic determinants, and obstacles to creating healthy food and food systems. Human diets inextricably link health and environmental sustainability. The present food system is one of the main causes of resource depletion and unacceptable environmental impacts, and is responsible for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, meeting nutritional needs for improved health while staying within “planetary boundaries” is the biggest challenge for humanity. Solving the problem of providing enough healthy food for all while maintaining environmental health requires a radical shift to a global food system that needs to draw on knowledge and skills from the many disciplines of both Science and Humanities. Eminent scholars will teach students from across the full range of disciplines in arts, biosciences, nutrition, medicine, agricultural science, and economics, plus practitioners from the food, nutrition, farm industry and the natural resource sector. Students will learn and develop methods to frame and discuss complex food and health-related issues through team exercises with fellow students."},{"title":"Global Cultures","description":"In the era of globalisation, contemporary cultures are increasingly shaped by transnational movements: of humans, commodities, and media, among other things. Global Cultures leads students to explore the human, subjective and cultural dimensions of these intensified transnational mobilities with a focus on the Asian region. Central concepts include mobilities, migration, cultural hybridity, translocality, precarity, and superdiversity. The subject introduces students to these concepts by drawing on theorisations from cultural studies and other disciplines in the humanities and, to some extent, social sciences, using contemporary, mainly Asia-based case studies to ground the conceptual material. The subject explores how lived experiences of mobility intersect with the power dynamics of gender, race, sexuality, and class, and engages with critical cultural theory to work toward not simply an understanding of globalisation as a series of social processes, but more importantly a cultural critique of globalisation. It introduces students to representations of mobility and globalisation across a range of popular media that may include film, television, Internet cultures and others, and explores how experiences of mobility––through migration, international education, tourism, mediated imagination and other modes––shape subjectivity."},{"title":"Indigenous Cultures and Knowledges","description":"Indigenous Cultures and Knowledges will introduce students to the diversity of Indigenous culture, epistemologies, practices and engagements with the contemporary world. It will also introduce students to the immense body of scholarship on traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies, cultures, languages, history and prehistory in curricula, research and knowledge exchange. The subject will be presented as a series of Masterclasses given by specialists from across the University with expertise in language and culture, environmental science and land management, social and political theory, education, music and performing arts, cultural heritage, and public health and wellbeing. Each Masterclass will be structured to include one or more of: A presentation/seminar by a guest lecturer or Indigenous knowledge holder on a particular field of Indigenous knowledge, such as: Indigenous environmental knowledge, including environmental science, and habitat management Indigenous astronomical knowledge Indigenous engineering knowledge, practices and adaption of local environments developed for food production, resource management, dwelling and settlement, and economic purposes The anthropology of Indigenous rituals and symbolism Key concepts expressed in Indigenous languages, linguistic understandings of polysemy, and translation and interpretation into English Ethnomusicology and The Arts Landscape and Place-making Cultural heritage and its preservation.

Students undertaking this subject will develop skills in identifying, mapping and designing street art in Melbourne’s laneways."},{"title":"Sustainability: hope for the Earth?","description":"‘The Earth is a finite environment, with its physical systems tightly interconnected with all life on the planet’. Humanity, as part of the Earth, is now in the historic position of changing the global balance of both the physical and biological environments, with unintended consequences. Achieving sustainability on Earth requires global values and actions that are ecologically sound, socially just and economically viable. In its Sustainability Charter, the University of Melbourne recognizes its responsibility to help shape sustainability on Earth through ‘knowledge, imagination and action’. This subject is an academic and practical opportunity for students to enter into that endeavor. In this subject we utilise sustainability to explore, understand and analyse human-environment relationships. Topics include: needs and inter-dependencies of all beings; the diverse ways humans meet their needs through material and non-material means and the ecological and social consequences of this for humans and other beings; the economic, social and political norms that shape the ways we meet our needs; the ethical and disciplinary frameworks through which the sustainability of human-environmental relationships can be assessed. We will consider sustainability of systems at multiple scales and through diverse ways of knowing including scientific, historical and Indigenous perspectives. Through this subject, students will develop foundational knowledge, skills and values to facilitate a sustainable future. This subject is relevant to students in all degrees who are interested in issues related to society and the environment such as climate change, land management, extractive industries and more. It will appeal to students that are seeking ways to support change in their lives and careers. Learning will be grounded in analysis of sustainability, with class room activities and assessment tasks designed so that students can directly and critically contribute to the University’s aspiration to be an international exemplar of an ecologically sustainable community; as well as to think critically about the function of their future discipline, and their own practices in facilitating sustainability. There may be some optional volunteering opportunities in sustainability. This subject is relevant to students in all degrees who are interested in issues related to society and the environment such as climate change, land management, extractive industries and more. In particular, it offers: Arts and Music students the opportunity to explore the intersection between power, hope and the arts to influence societies ideas about our relationship with the environment and sustainability; Biomedicine students conceptual tools like systems thinking and needs analysis to see how contextual drivers shape health outcomes for humans and the environment and the interdependencies between them, that can then influence sustainability; – Commerce students an insight into the history of capitalism and how it shapes our relationships with the environment and our ability to facilitate sustainability; – Design students a range of tools including multi-scale analysis and the integration of different discipline perspectives to generate new insights for sustainability; and – Science students the opportunity to build their critical assessment of the reasons and strategies for shaping sustainability including the retention of ecosystem services, as well as ethical decision frameworks. There is no exam in this subject, however, students are expected to make academic arguments, and work in teams."},{"title":"Thinking Tools for Wicked Problems","description":"Responding critically and ethically to contemporary issues, whether they be of local, national or global significance, requires one to go beyond the mere discovering of ‘facts’ and determining of ‘truths’. What one does with these ‘facts’ and ‘truths’ is equally important. What we claim to know may be helpfully understood in its emergence from and application to highly complex and seemingly intractable problems. Addressing such ‘wicked problems’ thoughtfully and collaboratively can reveal the nature of knowledge: how it is generated, how it is applied and contested, and what purposes it serves. Research areas in the Humanities, The Arts and the Social Sciences (HASS) as well as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will be introduced and problematised. Building on the ideas or C. S. Peirce, John Dewey and Matthew Lipman, this interdisciplinary subject will therefore focus on developing effective communities of inquiry, where the use of critical but cumulative talk is favored and where good questioning, in‐depth knowledge, sound reasoning and self‐reflection is applied to addressing and critically appraising wicked problems. To this end, the subject will examine wicked problems arising from a wide range of disciplinary areas and cultural perspectives, including: climate change skepticism, Indigenous knowledges, fake news, and major societal issues and innovations arising from recent advances in Science, Technology, and the Arts."},{"title":"Urban Design for People and Places","description":"Urban Design introduces the visual, spatial, social and design dimensions in planning for public spaces.

Very few countries today have the means to secure their own energy need through national supplies, and instead long-going dependencies upon other countries have developed. A widespread international trade of crude energy material started already in the 19th century, but has increased exponentially during the second half of the 20th century. Energy trade has included everything from wooden chips, peat, and ethanol, to coal, oil, gas, and uranium. This international trade has developed as a parallel process to the growth of as well new, radical energy technologies (nuclear, large scale water-power, gas power plants, combined power and heating, etc.) and large systems for transport and distribution of energy(in the form of electricity, heat, gas and oil)through pipelines and lines. At the same time, energy politics has become more and more entangled with other political fields, such as environmental politics, research- and innovation politics and foreign politics, which makes it more difficult to understand the development within the energy field. This course aims to give a deeper understanding of energy provision from a geopolitical and historical perspective. Some of the themes discussed during the course will include: International dependencies: gas, oil, uranium Transnational vulnerabilities Energy and national identity in a global perspective Energy and geopolitics during the cold war International energy crises – old and new The globalisation of energy politics and the EU as a new actor in energy politics Russia’s role The cybernetisation of energy systems The deregulation of the energy sector From national to global innovation systems in the energy area The nuclear fuel cycle as a critical infrastructure Energy and international terrorism"},{"title":"Political Ecology","description":"The course explores the interdisciplinary field of political ecology with a special focus on its historical dimension. Political ecology is a theoretical and methodological approach to the study of socio-ecological systems. It focuses on conflicts, power relations and uneven distribution of environmental costs and benefits. The field seeks to “politicise” debates about environmental problems, and thereby stands in contrast to â€ a-politicalâ€ ecologies that tries to understand environmental issues in terms of universal driving forces related to, for example, population trends or biophysical factors. The course intends to familiarise you with central concepts and tools used by political ecologists and thereby help you to take an active role in the political-ecological field if you wish. Unlike other sciences that you may be familiar with so far, political ecology does not work with experiments, modelling or quantitative analysis; instead, the course takes as its point of departure theoretical concepts that are documented through case studies which combine qualitative and quantitative information in an empirically-backed narrative (“story”). Each course occasion will focus on different key concept from political-ecological theory and use an important, published case study to illustrate how this concept is “put to work”."},{"title":"Sustainable Food Production and Consumption","description":"The course describes alternative food systems and the complexities associated with assessing their sustainability, and demonstrates the sustainability trade-offs between contrasting systems (e.g. local vs. global; extensive vs. intensive). Topics covered include: agroecology, food and farming systems, nutrient cycles, sustainability impacts, life cycle assessment, climate change, ecosystem services, biodiversity, land-use and water-use impacts, food security and sovereignty, trade, GMOs."},{"title":"Global Development and Political Ecology","description":"The course develops a critical theoretical framework based on three key concepts: uneven development, “thinking from the South,” and political ecology. Political ecology emphasises how all development is about social and environmental transformation with winners and losers that shape rural and urban landscapes and often with destructive environmental consequences. In parallel, we draw upon postcolonial thought to challenge from where development, sustainability, and urbanization can be understood, providing ample space to engage with knowledge centres, organisations, and civil society groups from cities and countries in the global South. This expands the places, experiences and researchers that can inform the theory and practice of development. Pedagogically, the course is based on creating a community of inquiry between students and the teacher. Lectures are followed by group work as well as seminars and individual consultation hours with the teacher. This creates an intimate learning environment, making it safe to both ask and try to answer difficult questions. Group work means to do a case study and receive training in applying theory to understand “messy realities.” You will also develop your essay writing skills with peer feedback and feedback from the teacher to support your growth as a writer and thinker."},{"title":"Entrepreneurship and Management","description":"Entrepreneurship.

How do different legal systems (traditional, religious, international, state) interact? How is access to land regulated according to the law? And how do people get access to land in practice? How do state courts deal with spiritual accusations about witchcraft if no material evidence is available? Why do people resort to justice “with their own hands” under certain circumstances? Which mechanisms do societies use to restore order and bring reconciliation to war-torn communities? Who rules in failing states? In this course we look at legal phenomena in their social context in today’s Africa, while taking into account historical pathways that have led to the current situation. We take a broad definition of law and governance that includes both formal and informal rules, practices, and authorities. We explore interactions between these different sources of ordering in society, how they function in practice, and the impact they have on everyday life in an Africa context. This will enable students not only to get a better understanding of law and governance in its context, but also about functioning of African societies, and ways in which people organise their lives. discussions."},{"title":"Trade and Finance in the Global Economy","description":"Countries nowadays are part of the global economy.

This course aims to enable the students to get to know a number of Berlin museums focussing on key aspects of memory of the Second World War and Post-WWII migration, using anthropological methods. Students are encouraged to critically analyse these reprentations within larger theoretical frameworks of “self” and “other” constructions, exploring the role of museums in rendering such constructions visible."},{"title":"Asia in Berlin. Critical Heritage Studies","description":"Berlin is a multi-cultural city with a diverse cultural life and heritage. The course will present critical heritage studies connected to Asia. Starting with the fascination of collectors and travelers to Asia during the colonial period, collections and material culture has lend contemporary relevance to the arts, history and politics. During the excursions to museums and cultural institutions in Berlin we want to critically engage in the discourses on what Asian heritage is and how it should be studied and managed. This allows an integration of heritage and museum studies. The course approaches a broad spectrum from crafts, intangible heritage and memorialization to rights policies and property issues. Monuments, religious sites or street names reflect Berlin’s colonial legacies and minority histories of different communities from Asia."},{"title":"The African Diaspora: diversity, citizenship and the politics of belonging in Berlin","description":"This course is designed to introduce students to the wide interdisciplinary perspective on diversity, politics of belonging and the status of citizenship of people within the African Diaspora in Berlin. The course will travel through the hidden geography of the so-called Afrikanisches Viertel in Wedding and focus on issues around public space, monuments, and street names from the 1960s to the present day that have anchored German colonialism. We will consider the relationship between colonialism and white supremacy in Germany, whilst examining the ongoing debate around how German (Anti-) racism has been influenced by earlier colonial ideology and practice. We will turn to the resurgence of colonialism as a theme in recent literature and historiography. Africa, in all of its cultural prosperity and diversity, remains alive in the receiving societies as the various ethnic groups created new cultures and recreated their old ways as much as circumstances allowed. Students are encouraged to critically analyse these representations with the intentional notion of undoing – unlearning within larger theoretical frameworks of the (in) visability of the African diaspora in Berlin. Exploring these themes plays an important role in understanding the intricacies of how different forms of citizenship are experienced and negotiated by people within the African diaspora."},{"title":"Colonial and Anticolonial Berlin: History, Society and Politics","description":"This course explores the complex historical and contemporary dynamics of German colonialism, anti-colonial resistance movements, and the impact of colonialism on present-day German society. Divided into four themes that intersect throughout the classes, the course provides a comprehensive understanding of the German colonial past, anti-colonial struggles in Berlin, contemporary Berlin as a site of colonial heritage, and the emergence of post-colonial and decolonial movements in the city. The first main theme is the German colonial era, in which we examine key historical events, colonial practices, and the territories under German control. We explore Berlin as a physical and symbolic space that reflects the remnants of German colonialism and consider how these remnants shape the city’s identity. The second one focuses on resistance movements against colonization. We study the diverse strategies and initiatives employed by individuals and communities who fought against German colonialism both in the colonies and in Berlin and the capital of the German empire. Moving into the third theme, we investigate the effects of colonialism on contemporary German society. We examine how colonial legacies continue to shape social, political, and cultural structures in Germany today. Topics include the influence of colonialism on immigration policies, racial dynamics, cultural heritage, and the representation of marginalized communities. As far as the fourth theme is concerned, we engage with postcolonial and decolonial contemporary movements. We critically examine different theoretical frameworks and approaches used to deconstruct colonial power structures, challenge Eurocentric narratives, and envision alternative futures. We explore the global context of decolonial movements and their relevance to Germany and Berlin specifically. Throughout the course, students will be able to develop critical thinking skills, gain historical knowledge, and engage in interdisciplinary analysis. By examining the German colonial past, anti-colonial resistance movements, and decolonial theories, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding colonialism and its aftermath, fostering a critical lens for interpreting and addressing contemporary issues of power, identity, and social justice in Germany and beyond."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":149,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.04,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":107,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":80,"upperBound":155}},"RW":{"amount":25,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.72,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":120,"upperBound":145}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":486,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.06,"upperBound":4},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":75,"upperBound":155},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"CA":{"amount":15,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.39,"upperBound":3.91},"DET":{"lowerBound":105,"upperBound":140},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.08,"upperBound":4},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":150}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/77-university-of-zagreb/","name":"University of Zagreb","available":true,"location":"Zagreb, Croatia","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 23, 2024","end":"February 18, 2025"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":78,"det":100,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Corporate Risk Management","description":"Objectives: analysis of macroeconomic environments & markets, selected companies’ business models, competitive strategies, SWOT & TOWS analyses, identifying key risks, evaluating impact on company’s goals, determining comprehensive risk management strategy"},{"title":"Strategic Human Resource Management","description":"The goal is to provide knowledge and help develop skills for human resource management in organizations.

To have collective decision making between institutes and hospitals concerning infectious diseases and outbreaks , it is necessary to have knowledge about prevention, disease characteristics, containment, modelling, sequencing, rational antimicrobial treatment and control of infectious diseases in both hospital and community settings. Additionally, differences between communities are key in understanding the epidemiology of an outbreak, for example hesitance and variety in low/high resources facilities. Outbreak management, comparable to what we have experienced during the coronavirus outbreak, will be discussed. This course prepares students for a research and clinical internship in the area of infectious diseases and infection control. All knowledge gained through the varied forms of education, will be directly translated and used in a research team project. The course uses various interactive and experience-based teaching manners, such as lectures, group work, presentations, joining a point prevalence study in the hospital, a table-top exercise on outbreak control in the hospital, a serious on outbreak control in the community a serious game, and several excursions (TB clinic, RIVM). This course entails the following learning objectives: 1. Gain profound understanding of how genetic diversity and antigenic variation in infectious diseases is related to infectious disease pathogenesis, transmission and evolution. 2. Participate in a multidisciplinary antibiotic stewardship team by having active knowledge of the working mechanisms of antimicrobials, knowledge on when to use which antibiotic, and how micro-organisms can counter antimicrobials (antibiotic resistance). 3. Develop and present hospital infection control programs by understanding the concept of hospital infection prevention and control on a patient level, including the understanding of different indications for patient isolation, different types of isolation and the criteria for ending isolation. 4. Apply the theoretical basis of infectious disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, vaccine epidemiology and infectious diseases and prevention & control into practice and science settings. Acquire modelling skills and to be able to use them for the prediction of the effect of interventions on an outbreak. 6.

The course will cover what AI is and an example of how AI techniques can be applied to an existing software system. In the part on probability theory, different aspects will be covered including probability distributions, conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem. In this part of the module, you will learn how to derive probabilities, as well as how to reason and calculate with them. In the societal impact part of the module, we will focus specifically on how recent developments in cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence and neuroscience raise various practical issues for individuals and society. Moreover, we will apply a philosophical approach (conceptual analysis, ethical discussion, identification and clarification of intuitions, basic assumptions and potential societal implications) in order to address the fundamental questions underlying these practical issues. Finally, we will practice how cognitive scientists could (and should) contribute to the public debate, thereby assisting responsible decision making about (un)desired research directions and applications of resulting technologies such as cognitive enhancement, robots and brain-computer interfaces.

In recent decades, national borders have become less important. In economic, political and cultural areas, transnational networks have emerged that take little or no account of the traditional territorial boundaries of nation states. This is a positive development for people who have the resources and capabilities to use these networks. However, a large part of the world population is cut off from these global networks and their benefits. Many people are well aware of structural injustice and better alternatives, but rarely have the opportunity to improve their situation. Against this background the question arises what ‘justice’ can mean in a world that increasingly becomes smaller. To what extent can we realize our ideals of freedom, equality, solidarity, and sustainability in a world in which individuals and communities are increasingly dependent on each other? Are there principles of global justice? And if so, who has the duty to comply with these principles, and which international structures do we need to guarantee them? These questions are dealt with on the basis of a problem-based approach that looks at current themes such as poverty and socio-economic inequality, international trade, social responsibility of multinationals, distribution of natural resources, and climate justice. Test information Students are required to write an essay and to give a presentation. The final result will be composed out of the following elements: – Examination: 50% – Presentation: 30% – Essay: 20%. Philosophy of International law This course provides a discussion of the foundations of and critical approaches to human rights. On successful completion of this course, you will be able to: • explain different philosophical approaches to human rights; • explain the strengths and weaknesses of the various foundations of and challenges to human rights; • relate philosophical debates on human rights to current issues in human rights law; • form an opinion on a current human rights issue, using philosophical approaches to human rights. Since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 international law has recognized an increasing number of human rights. Political activists in the North and the South appeal to human rights and so do many states (even when their actions violate human rights law). Yet, despite becoming a global ‘moral lingua franca’, human rights remain controversial. Various social movements and thinkers call for the recognition of new human rights, such as rights of the peasants, LGBTI+-rights and collective rights. However, classic liberals, and states such as the US, have argued against what they see as the ‘erosion of human rights’ and want to limit human rights to a core of political and civil rights. More fundamentally, the legitimacy of human rights is hotly debated. Marxist, feminist and postcolonial critics argue that human rights do not represent universal values, but that these rights propagate an individualist and market-driven way of life. While some critics call for a transformation of human rights, others urge us to drop human rights altogether. These debates raise all sorts of urgent questions: Are human rights genuinely universal, and, if so, what is the most appropriate foundation of human rights? Is it desirable to make room within international law for new rights? Are human rights really a defense against oppression or do human rights serve the powerful and deepen injustice? And, if we are to move beyond the (current) human rights framework, what alternatives exist to address injustice? Tests: Take home essay Global Labor Justice At the end of this course, you are able to: • Distinguish and describe several perspectives vis-à-vis the relationship between human rights and religion, reflect on them, and take an argued position of your own; • Differentiate between the different generations of human rights, and explain the tensions between particular human rights, especially when it comes to the acknowledgement of religious and other normative perspectives; • Explain and illustrate how human rights culture is induced or reduced by the convictions of normative communities and religious traditions; • Recognize and describe specific contributions to human rights discourse coming from religious or normative communities; • Apply concepts coming from the social sciences and religious studies to the study of human rights; • Explain the context of contemporary issues in which human rights discourse and religion seem to clash. The judicial inscription of human rights in legislation and regulation (i.e. the legality of human rights), is important, but the extent to which people at large agree with these positivized human rights and support them (i.e. the legitimacy of human rights) is at least equally meaningful. Acceptance and support of human rights is not only defined by individual circumstances, but it is also determined by the values and norms of the particular group(s) individuals belong to. These groups can be both religious and secular/philosophical in nature. In this course, we explore the relationship between human rights discourse and such normative communities. Is religion good for the development of a human rights culture, or does religion hinder the application of human rights? This is a question that has been and is still discussed in philosophical as well as religious circles. In the first part of the course, we will encounter several different perspectives on this question, taking both extremes as their starting point, and students will be challenged to argue for their own position. In the second part of this course, we will discuss contemporary contexts from around the world in which human rights discourse and normative communities are interacting or at odds with each other. We will get to know and apply concepts from the social sciences and religious studies, such as globalization, identity politics and fundamentalism to understand these situations better. Studying these contexts raises the question of whether human rights are and should be universal or not. Test information The examination is based on a written exam at the end of the term. A reflection paper on the student’s own position concerning the relationship between religion and human rights is also part of the examination. Paper: 30% Written end-of-term exam: 70%"},{"title":"Module: Ecology and Sustainability","description":"The Radboud Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies offers three modules for IISMA students. The modules comprise three courses in the Philosophy, Politics and Society bachelor programme. You can only take a course (5 ECTS) if you also take the two associated courses during the same semester. An entire module will be 15 ECTS. In order to secure a diverse population at max three Iisma students can be allowed for a module. This module comprises three courses – Ecophilosophy in the Anthropocene At the end of this course, you will have the ability to: • identify the key debates, central issues and dominant philosophical positions with regard to the Anthropocene; • critically assess the philosophical robustness and soundness of these philosophcal positions, and to identify options for their improvement; • distinguish, assess and identify the basic eco-philosophical concepts and theories in the philosophical debates on the Anthropocene; • critically apply these eco-philosophical concepts and theories to concrete current ecological and geopolitical issues. There is hardly any question about it: ‘the environment’ dominates all the social, economic, political and even individual agendas in our days – climate change and rising sea levels, biodiversity and species extinction, pollution, sustainability, energy transition: there is no escape. For philosophers, these issues raise the most profound question in at least three areas: metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy – the three areas represented in the ‘Ecology and Sustainability’ module. This particular course, ‘Ecophilosophy in the Anthropocene’, focuses on the Anthropocene as a new way of understanding the global ecological crisis, i.e., as the geological epoch following the Holocene, in which the human (anthropos) has become the most important geological factor, from now on crucially determining the fate of the biosphere. In general, this course deals with the metaphysical, ontological and anthropological implications of the Anthropocene and what it means for rethinking the human condition. It also reflects on the widespread recognition of an ecological turn in philosophy and the humanities more generally. The course consists of two parts. In the first part we will first take a look at the scientific debate on the Anthropocene and then reflect philosophically on some of the central issues, in particularly focusing on (socio)ecological complexity and on the discussions around biodiversity and extinction, including the possibility of human extinction. We will also introduce students to geophilosophy and demonstrate its usefulness for reflecting on the Anthropocene. Authors to be discussed in this part include Gilles Deleuze, Michel Serres, Andreas Malm and Timothy Morton. In the second part we will first present an overview of the prevailing narratives on the Anthropocene and then reflect on what these imply for rethinking the Earth and the relation between humanity and the Earth in light of the necessity of re-earthing humanity so as to ensure the possibility of human habitation on the planet. It will then focus on the technological dimension of the Anthropocene through a discussion of the notion of the technosphere as the new decisive geosphere, both on what this means from an energetic perspective and from the question of human agency and responsibility. Finally it will reflect on the necessity of a new terrestrial ethos in relation to the question concerning technology. Authors to be discussed in this part include Clive Hamilton, Bruno Latour, Peter Sloterdijk and Bernard Stiegler. Tests Paper -Political Ecology After this course, you will have the ability to: • identify the possible political and social implications of eco-philosophical positions on environmental ethics, environmental collective action, and the relevant moral subjects of environmental thought; • critically assess the philosophical robustness and soundness of these views, and to identify options for their improvement; • distinguish, assess and identify the influence of basic eco-philosophical concepts and theories in ‘green’ political and political–economic thought; • do the same with policy-informing scientific reports – and to identify and qualify any form of bias in such reports. There is hardly any question about it: ‘the environment’ dominates all the social, economic, political and even individual agendas in our days – climate change and rising sea levels, biodiversity and species extinction, pollution, sustainability, energy transition. There is no escape. For philosophers, these issues raise the most profound question in at least three areas: metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy – the three areas represented in the ‘Ecology and Sustainability’ module. This particular course, ‘Political Ecology’, focuses on debates on sustainability and environmental policy, economics and politics. Sustainability refers to the way in which resources of the planet can be used in such a way that needs and demands of current generations can be met while also guaranteeing the needs and rights of future generations of humans. The sustainability debate focuses, in other words, on the way in which human societies impact the global ecosystem and aims to find new concepts and understandings of politics and economy that reflect an understanding of the dependence of human well-being on the global ecosystems. Concrete topics include: Ecology and economy: new economic models (circular and steady state economy, bio-based economy, degrowth, commons, permaculture, etc.); Environmental and intergenerational justice; ecologism versus liberalism versus republicanism; ecomodernism; Climate politics and the IPPC process. – Critique of Green Ideology At the end of this course, you will have the ability to: • identify key issues and debates within (critique of) green ideology • situate critique of green ideology to related fields, such as ecocriticism and ecofeminism • critically asses the concepts of ecology and sustainability, and identify options for their salvageability; • critically apply these eco-philosophical concepts and theories to concrete current ecological, social and (geo)political issues. Content There is hardly an organization, business or government left that hasn’t put “sustainability” front and centre, our own university included. In the meantime, as the latest IPCC reports attest to, the climate crisis is deepening. What are we talking about when we talk about sustainability? And what do we aim to sustain? How to distinguish mute and/or strategic references to a sustainable world and greenwashing, from attempts to actually change things? In this course we explore the genealogy of the concept of sustainability, as well as that of ecology, and their functioning within “green ideology.” In the first part of the course we trace the concept of ecology from its original conceptualization in the work of German zoologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, its development in the 20th century, both in science and the environmental movement from the 1950’s onwards, to the “explosion of ecologies” that is currently taking place, that some argue requires a general ecology and even concerns an “ecologization of thinking.” In the second part of the course we engage with the concept of sustainability. Here we mainly focus on the transition of the concept from the 1970s onwards. We trace how it changed from a critical concept that challenged economic hegemony, reminding us of ecology and of the limits to growth, into “sustainable development” – more of a managerial concept than a critical (eco-)political one – to the “empty signifier” it seems to have become. Can the critical kernel of sustainability be salvaged? In the third part we explore the functioning of these two concepts within green ideology, also addressing related ideals such as circular (bio-)economy, green growth and green capitalism, and notions such as resilience and regeneration. Do they really challenge the status quo or in fact strengthen it? In order to answer that question and find what a critique of green ideology requires and entails, we will discuss both (the possibility of) “critique” and (the functioning of) “ideology”. In order to do so properly, we will explore related fields of theory and critique, such as ecocriticism and eco-/environmental feminism as well. Readings will include Val Plumwood, Timothy Morton, Yannis Stavrakakis, Bruno Latour and Slavoj Žižek. Test information The assessment includes a presentation, a midterm proposal and a final paper on (one of) the topics discussed in this course."},{"title":"Medical biotechnology towards clinical practice","description":"Medical biotechnology comprises the application of living cells or cell material in the development or generation of products to prevent, diagnose or treat human disease. Historical examples of biotechnology in support of medicine are the development of vaccines against smallpox and the production of antibiotics or human insulin by bacteria or yeast. Exciting 21st century developments are genetic engineering with CRISPR/Cas (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020), gene therapy, mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and stem cell-based regenerative medicine. Medical biotechnology is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field, integrating molecular, cell biological, genetic and immunological research areas. The first part of this Minor runs together with the course NWI-MOL104 Medical Biotechnology for students from the Faculty of Science and provides an overview of how interdisciplinary efforts help shaping modern healthcare by developing biotechnological diagnostics and therapeutics for precision medicine. Principles and concepts of medical biotechnology will be discussed in a scientific and medical context, including legal, societal and ethical considerations. Together with students from different life sciences disciplines you will write a medical biotechnological research proposal and present this at a mini-symposium. In the second half of the Minor you will carry out experiments in four different projects in the lab. These include molecular diagnostics (e.g., PCR, sequencing), recombinant DNA techniques, recombinant protein production, cell culture and adhesion assays, and cell transfection experiments mimicking gene therapy. Altogether, Medical Biotechnology towards Clinical Practice presents an excellent practical and theoretical course for students interested in molecular life sciences and in biotechnological innovations for patient care. Prerequisites: this is an advanced course in the broad field of Infectious Diseases. This course is only open for students from medicine, biomedical sciences or (human) biology. Period: Course is two full days per week (Thursday and Friday) September 2023-January 2024"},{"title":"History of Biology","description":"Aims At the end of this course, you are able to: 1. Recognise basic connections and tensions between biology and society through historic examples, in order to better appreciate such tensions in the current practice of biology. 2. Recognise and appreciate the variety of styles and organisation of research in research in reference to basic examples from the history of biology. 3. Recognise and understand the importance of social processes (such as fame, selective attention) for the development of research, at a basic level. 4. Understand how different approaches to history and current concerns affect how history is presented, based examples from the history of biology, at basic level. 5. Refer to the basic canon in the history of biology, including key names and crucial stories that are essential to the identity of a biologist (such as Darwin or Mendel). The history of biology is rich and full of remarkable stories, which are often surprisingly relevant for the present. For example, some theoretical puzzles and tensions in taxonomy that date back to the 18th century remain unresolved today. Similarly, there are exciting analyses of the problematic assumptions at the historic roots of evolutionary theory. History also offers us important warnings, such as for what can go wrong once totalitarian regimes determine what is good science and what is not. With the right perspective and the right kind of questions, the history of biology can offer instructive insights for fundamental theoretical problems, for the sometimes difficult relations between biology and society, and even offer a glimpse of half-forgotten knowledge. History also offers reflection on what is probably the toughest question of the discipline: what actually is biology? It may sound like a dreadful cliché, but the aim of this course is to learn from the past. The course will not present you with an endless stream of historic facts or isolated funny anecdotes (although some of the history of biology can be quite entertaining). The stress will be on the interpretation of history: we will try to understand patterns and relations in the development of biology, rather than list who discovered what, where, and when. To this end, the course is constructed around three main points: biology is diverse, biology is always connected to society, and biology has made mistakes from which we can learn a lot. For these purposes, the course will focus on the history of biology since the 18th century, where the most concrete connections with the current practice of biology can be made. With respect to diversity, the course will offer an overview of styles in doing biology, which will show that, historically, there were many different ways of doing biology. For example, whereas current biology is often dominated by laboratories and molecular biology, biology also has a rich heritage of a taxonomical style of research. In this style, the most important centres of biological research were museums of natural history, botanic gardens, and other collections of specimen that were carefully collected, often on long and adventurous expeditions to exotic places. We will see how the laboratory gained a foothold in biology towards the end of the 19th century and then gradually expanded its reign through the rise of genetics and later molecular biology. We will not only look at the development of biological ideas and research practices, but pay special attention to the development of the relation between biology and society. We will find out where biologists got their research funds in the past, how biological thinking incorporated ideas from wider culture, but also how biology had a profound societal impact itself. We will follow biologists around as they tried to improve agriculture, fought infectious diseases, or became activists calling for nature conservation and environmental protection. If we want to learn from history, then we should not only focus on the success stories and show cases, such as the discovery of the structure of DNA, or revered heroes such as Charles Darwin. We should also have the courage to see the dark side of biology’s history, such as the flirtations with eugenics or racism. For it is only when we have the courage to look in the dark corners that we may find the means to confront such monsters, should they once again rear their ugly heads. While the course does not require you to learn a lot of dates and names by heart, there is a basic list of names and stories any biologist should know, as part as your professional identity and frame of reference: the canon of biology. After all, how can you be a biologist and not know about Darwin, Mendel, or Watson&Crick. While any canon is somewhat aribitrary, this course too contains a list of essential names and stories in their historic setting. Test Assessment for the course consists of a computer exam (80% of the grade) with multiple choice and short open questions. The remaining 20% of the grade is based on answering at least five questions about the course material on joint bulletin boards. Strictly speaking, this is optional, but you need at least a 5 for the exam and a 5,5 overall grade to succeed."},{"title":"Globalising Worlds / Human Geography","description":"This course focuses especially on global issues affecting the so-called Global South. This relates to issues such as climate change, trade, city planning, human mobility and transnational cooperation. In this course we seek to offer alternative approaches to interactions conceived as processes of globalisation by explicitly linking them to specific areas in the world, helping to thereby provide an integral analysis of place-space interconnectivities in globalisation processes. In this course we thereby also reveal how the spatial sciences have a key role to play in helping to literally and conceptually locate globalisation, to not only understand ‘why’ and ‘how’ but ‘why there’ it is grounded. The course will focus on societal changes arising out of local impacts of globalization. This, for instance, relates to particular forms of urban development (exploding cities, uneven cities, networked cities). Themes such as mobility, are explored in greater depth, with specific attention given to situations in the Global South. Key themes discussed in this course are: • On the move: globalization, capital mobility and human migration • Sustainability issues for a globalized world? Access to natural resources, globality of sustainable / wasteful societies • A global urban world: ‘planetary urbanism’, planning of growing mega-cities, the duality of formal/informal urban economies. Characteristics: Globalisation, sustainable development (including discussion of policy goals), local-global challenges, various domains linked to livelihoods in the global south, global south – north connections Period: September 2023-January 2024, level Ba 2, written exam"},{"title":"Borders and Identities in Europe","description":"In this course we will analyse the often implicit logic of the territoriality of the European integration process. In particular, after briefly discussing the historial construction of the European Union and the idea of Europe, we will study the continuous importance and impact of the social construction of internal national borders and the influence of populist nationalism in the European Union. And we will look at the financial, refugee and corona crisis which has led to new nationalism on the one hand and new federalism on the other. Then, we will analyse the ongoing cross-border collaboration between border regions at the internal borders of the European Union. Next, we will critically study the international migration at the external borders of the EU and the resulting externalisation policies. Lastly, we will study the possible futures of the European Union. After completing the course Borders and Identities in Europe the student is able to: • Understand the academic and social debate on the continuous (re)production of national borders and identities in and of the bordering of EUrope itself as well cross-border cooperation in the EU and with the near abroad outside the EU. • Critically analyse and discuss these developments of (re)production and actively participate in discussions on the topic Period: September 2023-January 2024, level Ba 2, written exam"},{"title":"Space and Environment in the European Union","description":"The European Union (EU) exerts a strong influence on its member states. It constitutes a new politico-administrative layer above national states, affecting national policies, politics and polities in a wide range of areas, including environment and planning. At the same time, national governments retain a crucial role in European integration. National civil servants and politicians are deeply embedded in the development and adoption of EU policies, as well as in their implementation ‘back home’. Many people see the EU as highly complicated or even mind-boggling. ‘Brussels’ defies easy categorization in terms of its structure, governance process and operational logic. On top of this, it is under constant (re)construction. To further complicate things, the EU is facing a number of existential crises and challenges: BREXIT, the financial crisis and migration to name a few. The EU is regularly criticized by national media and politicians, and distrusted by the people – either for being ineffective and weak, or for being too dominant and imposing on the member states. These criticisms also relate to spatially relevant and environmental policies. In sum, the EU is important, complex, and heavily contested. For these reasons, it is imperative for students of planning and environmental policy to develop a deep understanding of processes of European integration and governance in those particular areas as well as more generally. The course ‘Space and environment in the EU’ (SEEU) will be given in close cooperation with the course ‘European Governance’ offered by the Department of Public Administration. The course is divided into four themes: (1) introduction and background, (2) government and administration, (3) the policy process, (4) implementation and Europeanisation. Knowledge and insights specific to the fields of spatially relevant and environmental policies will be further developed in a number of lectures and working groups. Aims After finishing the course Space & Environment in the European Union the student is able to: • Understand and explain the processes of EU policy-making and decision-making as well as the effects of spatially-relevant and environmental policies in the EU member states and regions; • Understand and explain, from a theoretical perspective, the processes and outcomes of a Europeanisation of spatial and environmental policy arrangements and planning systems; • Reflect on the governance arrangements, policy objectives and spatial and environmental impacts of EU policies, and to discuss the different channels of influence through which these policies achieve their objectives; • Apply the most important concepts, developments and policies of the EU in the field of environment and planning to specific issues of spatial and/or environmental relevance. Lectures and working groups Period: September 2023-January 2024, level Ba 3, written exam"},{"title":"Intercultural Communication","description":"This course offers students an introduction to intercultural communication and the factors that shape and influence it. Due to globalization, migration and international work mobility, intercultural contact between people from different cultures -and different language backgrounds- has become more common in recent decades. Societies have become increasingly multicultural. Intercultural communication is a part of life for most people, in both everyday and work contexts. For business professionals who work in an international setting, or for students studying abroad, it is important to have insight into the ways in which culture can play a role in intercultural contact situations, in terms of behaviour in general and interpersonal communication in particular. This course considers the concept of culture, and how culture influences our thinking, acting and being. It examines the influence of culture on verbal and non-verbal communication, the relationship between culture, identity and communication, and how cultural value orientations influence our worldview and the way we behave towards others. The course also considers topics such as acculturation in immigrants and expats, culture shock, and the development of intercultural (communication) competence. At the end of the course, students will: • Be able to identify and describe fundamental theoretical concepts and principles that are relevant to understanding communication between people from different cultural and social backgrounds; • Have insight into the concept of culture, cultural differences and how culture can influence verbal and non-verbal behaviour; • Have insight into contributors to – and issues in – intercultural communication today, and be able to reflect critically on these; • Have insight into acculturation/cultural adaptation, culture shock, and the development of intercultural (communication) competence, and be able to identify and critically reflect on factors that play a role in these processes English level B2 is necessary, Ba 1 course"},{"title":"Psychology and Media Content","description":"In this module, students will get a general introduction in psychology, an introductory course in research methods and a course on media content. The course will start outlining what Psychology is about: which questions does it want to answer and how does it do so? During the course we will cover multiple subdisciplines such as biological, social, developmental and clinical psychology. Topics that will be discussed include memory, consciousness, perception, emotion, personality and psychological disorders and their treatment. In addition, you will become acquainted with various research methods used in the field of psychology. Additionally, you will gain insight into the advantages and disadvantages of various research methods used to answer research questions in the social sciences. Next to teaching you about psychology, the course also encourages you to reflect on your future professional career. Besides the above-mentioned curriculum there will be weekly exercises to guide this reflection process. You will learn not only to question your own assumptions but also help others questions theirs by providing constructive feedback and discussion. If we want to improve our knowledge, we consult media. Whether we refer to social media, documentaries, or newspapers, all of these media carry meanings about the world. Even if we turn to media for entertainment they will provide us with images of the world around us. Media content is built on representations. As is science. Science, more specific scientific papers, offer access to (a specific part of) reality by creating representations of reality based on scientific methods and rules. The scope of this part of the module concerns media content. How do we know the world? What are the most important systems of representations that shape media content (images, language, narrative, rhetoric)? In communication science content analysis is a distinctive method. However, different theories create different perspectives on ‘content’ and therefore will read content differently. At the end of the module you will have an overview over the discipline of psychology and research methods in the social sciences. In addition, you are invited to act as a participant in research projects of other students to increase your understanding of the participants point of view and to be introduced to a wide variety of labs and research approaches. At the end of this module: • You’ll be able to distinguish different perspectives on media content. • You’ll be able to describe the relationship between ‘reality’ and its symbolic ‘representation’. • You’ll be able to identify and apply different signs and sign systems that shape media reality, in the analysis of media content. This minor entails the following learning objectives: • You’ll have an understanding of the field of psychology and its subdisciplines. • You’ll have insight into how different factors can influence human thinking, feeling and behavior. • You’ll understand how the empirical cycle is used to answer questions about human behaviour. • You’ll able to identify advantages and disadvantages of various research methods used to answer psychological research questions. • You’ll be able to assess the relevance of research articles (scientific and popular-scientific) and formulate critical questions about them. • You’ll develop personal skills for giving and receiving feedback in a professional and constructive manner, both verbally and written. • You’ll be able to critically reflect on your development as an academic professional and you can communicate your perspective verbally and written. • You’ll be able to distinguish different perspectives on media content. • You’ll be able to describe the relationship between ‘reality’ and its symbolic ‘representation’. • You’ll be able to identify and apply different signs and sign systems that shape media reality, in the analysis of media content. Assessment for this module consists of several elements: 1. Weekly multiple-choice tests 2. Written examination consisting of open-ended questions about research and methods. 3. Multiple-choice exam with a minimum passing grade 5.5 out of 10 Period: August 2023 – January 2024."},{"title":"Module: Religious Contacts and Conflicts","description":"The Radboud Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies offers three modules for IISMA students. The modules comprise three courses in the Philosophy, Politics and Society bachelor programme. You can only take a course (5 ECTS) if you also take the two associated courses during the same semester. An entire module will be 15 ECTS. In order to secure a diverse population at max three Iisma students can be allowed for a module. Three courses: The Silk Road: Religious Cultures, Conflicts and Contacts from Europe to China You will both deepen and broaden your knowledge of the religions and cultures that have developed along the ‘Silk Road’. You’ll develop insight into the most signficant interactions between Asia and the West. The Silk Road, which ran between Europe and China, was not just a trade route, but also a conduit for the distribution of ideas and religions from East to West and vice versa. By focusing on the ancient Silk Road, this course highlights the important role this area played in the formation and spread of religious cultures. The course introduces the world’s major religions, it familiarizes students with the basic tenets of each tradition, and looks at a number of specific instances of interaction between religions and cultures in this region. Test: Written Exam State and Diversity: Politics and the Role of Religion in North-Africa and the Middle-East After completing this course, you will be to understand: • political developments in the Middle east and North Africa in the modern and contemporary periods; • economic evolutions in the Middle East and North Africa after the colonial era; • role of religious movements and activism in the Middle East-North Africa region; • difficulties and opportunities to generate rule of law, modern citizenship, and democratic systems in the MENA region; • local, national and regional political and mobilizations in the MENA region; • cultural, demographic, and anthropological changes in the MENA region in the last several decades. State and Diversity is a crash course in Middle Eastern politics and the special role Islam plays in the political process. In twelve classes it deals with the most important topics and debates among political scientists working on the region. Topics to be analyzed include the social structure of societies in the region, the role of the authoritarian states, the “oil curse” and the rentier state, the way political parties function, the limitations of civil society, the position of women, and the permeability of the region and the interference of foreign powers. Special attention will be given to the role Islamic movements play in the region and the so-called “sectarianization” of political conflicts. The central question is why the Arab Spring (2010-2011) happened and why the dominant political theories failed to predict these uprisings. In addition, we will discuss possible future developments in the region. Test information The examination is based on the writing of essays Dying for God: Martyrdom, Terrorism and Religious Violence In addition to becoming familiar with narratives of violence and suffering related to the three religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), a significant goal of the course is to understand how the concept of “religious violence” functions in a broader discourse of religion, politics, and society. By the end of the course, therefore, you will be able to: • identify and describe a wide range of primary texts produced by Jews, Christians, and Muslims from antiquity through today that comprise stories of martyrdom and violence; • discuss in a critical manner why the terms “martyrdom”, “terrorism”, and “religious violence” are more than simple, descriptive labels; • understand how the concept of “religious violence” functions in a broader discourse of religion, politics, and society; • summarize how different religious traditions, political groups, and modern audiences have employed stories about dying/killing for God in their respective historical contexts; • evaluate and explain the various uses of these texts in contemporary discourse, especially political, social, and ethical discussions; • clearly and effectively respond to the course materials, both orally in the context of class discussion, and in written form. What makes a martyr? What makes a terrorist? How and why would an individual be willing to die and/or kill for God? These are some of the questions this course explores as we consider how martyrdom, terrorism, and violence (more broadly defined) are significant concepts in the discourse of religious identity, from antiquity until today. During the course students will read and discuss several ancient, medieval, and modern narratives of violence and self-sacrifice in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic contexts. In analyzing these texts we will not only consider what function their tellings (and retellings) may have for their respective religious communities, but we will also question why such accounts of violence are considered so striking. Why are certain actors defined as “martyr” and others as “terrorist”, who is doing the labeling, and for what purpose. What are the ideological or political motivations for such designations, and what kinds of conflicts arise when communities compete over them? Thus, a major goal of this course is to uncover and describe why religious communities, political groups, and/or scholars of religion are invested in making such identifications. This course will consider the intersection of religion and violence in stories about dying and killing for God, and the impact of these images on political and social discourse in both historical and contemporary contexts. Test information Active participation in seminar discussions; interim assignments; and a final paper"},{"title":"Biology and Society","description":"Aims – The different roles of biologists in society – The challenges and dilemmas that biologists face in these different roles – The basic principles of communication between dissenters Content The Biology and Society course focuses on the role of the biologist in society. Biologists are employed in a variety of roles in a variety of places. Think, for example, of biologists who work as policy makers for the government, as advisers for environmental organizations, as journalists, as teachers at schools or as researchers at knowledge institutions. For example, if farmers and conservationists cannot agree on how to deal with wild geese, biologists are asked to find out how many geese there are and what options exist for population management. And if an epidemic such as the Covid-19 pandemic breaks out, we ask doctors and medical biologists whether the vaccines are effective and whether it is wise to buy a large stock in the Netherlands, or when we can expect one in the future. As with all scientists, biologists do not operate in a vacuum. As a biologist you always work simultaneously in a scientific and a social environment. The Biology and Society course helps you to get to know the social environment and understand how it may work. This is done by looking at the relationship between biology and society in two ways, on the one hand from the perspective of ‘biology in society’ and on the other from the perspective of ‘society in biology. In the first perspective you should think of the numerous issues in society in which biology (and thus biological expertise) plays a role in one or the other way, such as the aforementioned issues with the wild geese and the threat of an epidemic, but also issues like ADHD, genetic screening, the increase in obesity, the use of laboratory animals in the lab, the so-called bio-based economy, global warming, the loss of biodiversity or the return of the wolf to the Netherlands. In many societal issues biologists are involved in many ways. The second perspective concerns the way in which society is present in and influences biological research practices and research agendas. For example, the government exerts influence on what is being researched by whom at a given time, for example in the form of the Netherlands Institute for Scientific Research (NWO), which funds a large part of scientific research in the Netherlands. But also to ethical committees, patient organizations, nature and environmental associations, concerned groups of citizens and/or individuals in society and, not to forget: the media have an impact on biological research. As a biologist, you have to deal with such societal actors to accomplish your goals. In this course we discuss different roles that you may adopt as a biologist in society and what you may encounter within this role in terms of societal issues. Test information Students are required to write a short essay (1500 – 2000 words) on a topical case of their choice, in which biologists play different societal roles. The aim of this essay is to examine the different ways in which biologists are involved in this topic, and to briefly discuss the specific possibilities and limitations of each role of biologists. For one of these roles, the student will more specifically identify which themes and related questions are at stake."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":65,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.11,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":111,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":110,"upperBound":125}},"RW":{"amount":15,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.11,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":94,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":106,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.05,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":90,"upperBound":102},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":5.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":15,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.17,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":102,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/78-vytautas-magnus-university/","name":"Vytautas Magnus University","available":true,"location":"Kaunas, Lithuania","academicPeriod":{"start":"August 22, 2024","end":"January 15, 2025"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":87,"det":100,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"GRAPHICS AND VISUALIZATION","description":"The course introduces students to computer graphics and its practical use in creating various visualizations.

We start from a simple, institution-free description of each question, try to understand the basic tensions at work, and derive institutions that optimally address these tensions. In the process, we introduce the important ideas of social choice, game theory, and market design. We will shed light on the theoretical concepts using empirical applications and in class games. The course is divided into four parts: 1. Social Choice, Efficiency and Welfare: We discuss normative criteria to evaluate collective choices made by a society comprised of individuals with possibly conflicting preferences (e.g. unanimity, not ruling out any preferences, not being dictatorial), and show that it is impossible to create institutions leading to choices that always satisfy even a minimal list of criteria. Next we introduce the possibility of pecuniary transfers to compensate individuals for social choices that harm them. We show that, when they are acceptable, Pareto efficiency and utilitarianism are equivalent, and a natural notion of social welfare emerges that ranks possible social choices. 2. Game Theory and Incentives: With this natural notion of optimal social choices, the question becomes a positive one: how can such choices be implemented. The difficulty is that the social value of different choices can only be assessed from the preferences of individuals. But each individual is the only one to know her true preferences, and must therefore be incentivized to provide this information. Institutions can be understood as rules of a game in which individuals strategically report their preferences. Game theory is the science of such strategic interactions, and we will introduce its basic ideas and some applications (e.g. competition between firms, tax fraud, bitcoin, pollution abatement). 3. Institutions as Mechanisms: At this stage, we are equipped to look for institutions that lead to efficient social choices in spite of asymmetric information about preferences. We will do so for three types of important economic problems: the allocation of private goods, the provision of public goods, and the organization of trade. We show that well designed auctions can solve the allocation problem. Using this as a starting point, we derive a general class of mechanisms that solve the incentive problem and lead to efficient social choices. They do so by using transfers that lead individuals to internalize the externality they exercise on others, and therefore align their incentives with social welfare. Such mechanisms however lead to budget deficits when applied to public good provision or trade. In fact, we show that efficiency cannot be achieved for these problems and we derive second-best solutions, that is, institutions that are optimal given the need to incentivize individuals. As the number of agents increases, we show that the inefficiency disappears, and that these second-best solutions come to resemble the ideal situation of perfectly competitive markets, thus providing support for the idea of market efficiency. For the public good problem, however, scaling if of no use. 4. Limits to Efficiency: In the last part of the course, we examine other possible sources of economic inefficiency. We start by looking at monopolies and their pricing strategies. We explain first, second and third-degree price discrimination. We explain how second degree-price discrimination can be understood as a mechanism designed to maximize profit rather than welfare. We also show how online information about consumers affects third-degree price discrimination, and use this to discuss the regulation of online data. Then we show how asymmetric information can destroy efficient trade even in competitive markets when they are subject to adverse selection and apply this idea to financial markets, job markets and insurance markets. Finally, we go back to auctions and the private good allocation problem, and show that a revenue-maximizing seller will optimally design auctions that distort efficiency."},{"title":"Introduction to the Political Economy of Global Food Systems","description":"The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (FAO, 2021). On the other hand, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organisation. This denotes the crisis in global food systems, resulting in a stark divide between people who are stuffed or starved – this course will identify the underlying structural issues beyond supply and demand for this phenomenon. Moreover, it will examine food production, distribution, and consumption issues across geographic scales, spanning the microcosm of the individual body to the national and global scales. We will follow the journey of food from plough to plate and in the process, this course will explore the political, socio-economic, geopolitical and cultural dimensions of food and eating in particular spaces, places, environments, contexts and regions. Empirical methodology will be used with a particular focus on case studies. In conclusion, we will examine the fundamental role played by food systems in shaping our civilization as well as the challenges and possible solutions and policy prescriptions to address those challenges."},{"title":"Mathemathics for Economists","description":"TIn this course, students will learn basic linear algebra necessary to understand the operations regarding derivatives of functions with more than one variable to investigate maximum and minimum values of those functions with economics applications in mind.

Probing deeper than traditional actors such as the state or political party, the course explores the motivations behind popular participation in modern state or political programs and movements, and especially those of the youth in Japan, China, and Cambodia. Moving chronologically from the Japanese Empire at the turn of the 20th century through Maoism and the Khmer Rouge to the current climate crisis, the course views mass mobilization and violence through a range of themes and topics: from ecological catastrophe and class rivalries to cultural practice and the uses of memory. To ensure that our subjects are considered in a broader, global perspective, the course has a comparative component that we pair with our secondary reading each week: François Bizot’s memoir of captivity by the Khmer Rouge,The Gate/Le portail, and Jan Gross’s study of genocide in Poland, Neighbors, which we read in full and discuss together over the course of the semester. We do this for what these and other readings reveal about the psychology of communal violence at the most intimate level and the sheer complexity of factors that have fueled some of the most troubling aspects of humanity in the modern era. We also view parts of two films together: L’Image manquante (The Missing picture, 2013) by Rithy Panh on the Cambodian genocide and Three Minutes: A Lengthening (Bianca Stigter/Glenn Kurtz, 2021) on Poland. Finally, the course ends with reflections on the politics of war remembrance, and the place of mass violence in a world facing climate change, water and resource crises, and rapid loss of bio-diversity."},{"title":"Diplomasea: Trade, Forces and Exchanges at Sea","description":"The Pacific Ocean is greater than the combined landmasses of the entire Earth. The Indian Ocean is vast body of Water with circa 20% of the world surface. The Atlantic Ocean can be perceived as the cradle of the occidental Civilization especially when the Mediterranean is included in its broad remit, nexus of exchange between European Nations, newly formed North American States, Latin American civilizations, the Caribbean and Africa. Our oceans are the earth’s largest habitats and have geopolitical impact and continuously excerpt major influence on global events as on regional decisions. Oceans matter deeply. Oceans contain valuable resources such as oil, natural gas and minerals and they are also homing futures promising strategic elements such as platinum group metals, steel stabilizers, high-tech metals and rare earth elements. The industrialization of the seas is expanding worldwide since green energies produced through wind, waves, deep currents, or variations of the salinization are mobilizing more and more interests Furthermore, playing a key role in the climate system, sciences are needed to understand, to monitor changes as to deploy alternative technologies to ultimately protect life. Oceans invite to exchanges and, often, to negotiate on common agreements. Following these needs for agreements and understandings, the seminar will help to identify history, debates, failures, challenges and opportunities for practitioners, decision-makers, from the world’s seas and oceans."},{"title":"Environmental Challenges in Asia","description":"The objective of the course is twofold. Firstly, it aims at equipping students with the capacity to think critically about today’s most pressing environmental problems: Climate change, deforestation, resource management, mining, environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, etc. Secondly, the course uses a comparative approach to provide students with an overview of how environmental problems unfold in Asian contexts. The class will try to address the following questions: ● What are the main environmental problems taking place in Asia? ● How are people affected? ● How do environmental issues affect transnational relations? ● What role do national governments, local governments, and civil society play in tackling them? ● What tradeoffs do governments and societies face? ● What does it say about domestic dynamics?"},{"title":"Chinese Constitutional Law in Comparative Perspective","description":"Does China have “a constitution without constitutionalism”? Or does China offer an alternative form of constitutionalism? Lacking the basic grammar of “Western” modern constitutionalism, such as the separation of powers and judicial constitutional review, the Chinese constitutional law is key to understanding many controversies about China in the international community, especially those concerning human rights protection and the governance of autonomous regions (such as Xinjiang and Tibet) and special administrative regions (notably Hong Kong). To help students better understand the characteristics of China’s political and legal system and reflect on the role of the constitution in a state and how it is implemented, this course provides a comprehensive introduction to the historical trajectory of constitution-making and constitution-amending in China, the features of the current constitution, and the latest developments of constitutional implementation, understood in the social, political, and economic contexts of China and from a comparative perspective vis-à-vis the West. At the same time, the course will familiarize students with some basic concepts in legal theory and constitutional law, as well as different approaches of comparative legal studies. The course begins with an introduction to the modern idea and practices of constitution and constitutionalism in the West and how the current Chinese constitution and practices measure up against them. The course then unfolds in three parts. In Part I, we will first review the constitutional reform in the late Qing Dynasty and the constitutional revolutions in the Republican Era. Then we will examine the making of the 1949 Common Program and the 1954 Constitution of the PRC and figure out the rationales for and the features of each constitutional amendment thereafter. Part II will focus on the current Constitution: the fundamental rights and duties of the citizens; the party’s leadership, the principle of democratic centralism and the division (rather than separation) of powers among state organs; the pluralist central-local relations in a unitary system, notably the regional ethnic autonomy and the “one country, two systems” policy, etc. In the final session, we will explore the idea of “constitutionalism beyond liberalism” and discuss where the Chinese experiences can contribute to our understanding of constitutionalism."},{"title":"Contemporary Constitutional Law","description":"This class considers how comparative constitutional law has influenced contemporary political institutions. As a starting point, we will examine the different ways in which the Constitution of the Vth French Republic has gained and maintained authority as the highest law of the land, despite apparent conflicts of sovereignty in a globalized world. Building on the analysis of the birth and evolution of political institutions, covered in the first-year course on comparative constitutional law, this second-year course will examine the underlying tensions within constitutional regulation, by exploring the concepts of constitutional identity, constitutional legitimacy, and constitutional efficiency in modern constitutional practice around the globe. We will question the role of the Constitution of the French Vth Republic in this comparative context, which is particularly important to students wishing to engage in effective careers of politics and government in an era of ever increasing popular contestation of State-centered regulation. The first four lectures compare the strengths and weaknesses of divers constitutional mechanisms in implementing the identity of a nation or a people, both institutionally (horizontal separation of powers) and geographically (vertical separation of powers). The four seminars corresponding to the lectures will confront the analysis gleaned from the ongoing French experience of the Vth Republic, as applicable to contemporary constitutional issues raised by fourth wave democracies following the Arab Spring (Tunisia, Egypt, Libya will be recurrent but non-exclusive examples) as well as to the evolution of constitutionalism in Asia (China, Japan, India). Special attention will be given to the notion of constitutionally regulated secularism in an increasingly non-secular world (Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon). The second part of the course (lectures 5-8) will approach the problem of long-term legitimacy of contemporary constitutions. To do so, we will confront divers constitutional practices to that of the Constitution of the Vth Republic, examining their political and legal adaptation to new forms of participation and representation (citizens in the electoral process, the “elected monarch” and the government, evolution of political parties, the legislative process, constitutional amendment, gender, minorities, lobbies…), and the effect and role of widened judicial review. The four corresponding seminars will consider how jurists across different systems (namely the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, United States, Germany, South Korea, India) have interpreted and implemented similar mechanisms. The final four sessions (lectures 9-12) will challenge the efficiency of modern constitutions, confronted with the expanding role of international law and supranational judicial bodies, notably in the area of rights adjudication and governmental regulation. The four corresponding seminars will then focus on current challenges to constitutional principles by regional law (European Union, Council of Europe) and international law, emphasizing the ambiguities of constitutional regulation of fundamental rights in the age of information technology and global terrorism. Depending on the evolution of the sanitary crisis, a hearing before the French Constitutional Council in Paris will enable students to observe an interpretive method hands on, and a conference-debate with a guest expert will illustrate the practical influence of comparative constitutional law on modern constitutional design."},{"title":"Comparative Politics","description":"What is Comparative Politics? How do we analyse politics comparatively? How can we make sense of the variation in the ways that political institutions and political authority are organised in contemporary societies? What are the effects of these multiple and different ways of organising politics? How do the main actors, institutions and processes that structure politics change across social and cultural settings? Finally, how does a comparative approach help us understand the contemporary world of politics? This course builds on the key concepts, theories and approaches introduced in the first-year course Introduction to Political Science by providing a more in-depth examination of the key elements that structure contemporary politics. It will focus, primarily, on established (mainly western) democracies but will systematically introduce comparative elements with political systems in all regions of the world (Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East) to provide students with a wider and global perspective of politics and of political analysis. The course will allow students to acquire the analytical tools to understand and examine politics comparatively and to reflect about it in a sophisticated manner. It will do so by providing students with an overview of the epistemological and methodological issues that are central to the definition of Comparative Politics, as well as of the various approaches that shape our understanding of this field of study within Political Science. The course will stimulate the development of a sophisticated understanding of politics by focusing on several key overaching themes in the study of Comparative Politics, as well as on a comprehensive overview of contemporary comparative analyses of political institutions, actors and processes. The 48 hours of lectures and seminars that form this core course in the Major in Politics and Government have been designed to offer students a coherent approach in their learning by combining and complementing the lecture materials with the readings and practical cases that will be discussed in the seminar sessions. Both components (lectures and seminars) are an integral part of the course, and experience indicates that only students that attend both the lectures and the seminars are likely to achieve good grades in the course. This entails actively engaging with the lectures and seminars, as well as carefully preparing the readings assigned for both the lectures and the seminars."},{"title":"Abcs of Politics: Theoretical And Practical Perspectives on Contemporary Politics (The)","description":"This course explores some of the central texts and key ideas of 20th and 21st century political theory. Inspired by the Abécédaire of Gilles Deleuze, the course is divided into thematic sessions that follow a seemingly playful, yet meaningful, alphabetic order. The course is divided into two main parts: the first, more historical in nature, will focus on key texts and authors in chronological order, from the end of World War II to the early 1990s. Besides discussing the content of the texts, these first lectures will give particular attention to the political and social context in which the texts were written. We will begin with the liberal critics of totalitarianism (Berlin and Hayek), continue with a discussion on The Frankfurt School and critical theory, Rawls’ idea of justice, Nozick’s critique of Rawls, and Okin’s feminist theory in Justice, Gender and the Family. The second part will deal with major topics and debates in contemporary political theory. We will first examine the tension between the ideas of virtue and right, merit, meritocracy and equality and multiculturalism and national identity. We will then discuss the topic of freedom of speech and reflect on the role of sex and sexuality in contemporary politics. Our course will end with a re-examination of the question ‘What is political theory?’ and focus on its role in today’s higher education. Considering public criticism leveled at certain political theories taught at universities in recent years (in France and other Western countries) we will ask whether ‘political theory’ is itself a topic in political theory. The course is accompanied by a weekly seminar. These sessions are designed to give students an opportunity to raise questions about the readings and lectures and to discuss them (and other relevant topics) openly and freely in small groups."},{"title":"Diplomacy in Practice","description":"Diplomacy, one of the oldest professions in history, has been called by Martin Wight “the master institution of international relations”. Its importance is recognized not only by practitioners, but also by researchers. To understand how diplomacy works – is to understand a good part of international relations. The seminar will invite students to explore the many facets of diplomacy as a core international activity, profession and practical art. The subject of the study will be discussed from a theoretical and practical points of view. We will first learn about diplomacy as a phenomenon of international relations: its history and evolution, the adaptation of its practices to evolving contexts. Then, we will study the practical matters of the profession: what diplomats do, how a Ministry of Foreign Affairs works, what are the tasks of diplomacy and what are the tools of communication, negotiation, and diplomatic representation. We will finally look at the multiple roles that diplomats fulfill in their professional lives and – in a very practical way – how one becomes a diplomat. One part of each session will consist of a debate prepared by the students on a topic of current affairs – an opportunity to get a feel of the communicative dimension of diplomacy."},{"title":"Narratives and Representations of the Past","description":"Historians are part of the process of representing, writing and appropriating the past. Their approach is based on a quest for truth and objectivity, and on precise procedures to provide evidence. This endeavor coexists with the multiple social and political interpretations of the past, which have proliferated over the last forty years (referred to as the so-called “memory boom”). Due to memory claims, demands for reparations, ideological constructions and the “invention of tradition”, numerous and contradictory discourses have flourished and taken on various forms (literature, cinema, visual arts, commemorations, collections, etc.). As a shared object, the past is at the heart of political and social conflicts, notably through the major process of “competitive victimhood”. The very goal of this course is thus to understand the background, logic and forms of these various uses of the past, and to define the specificity of historical knowledge, its requirements and objectives, as well as its possible role in the current context of political nationalism, ideological negationism, religious fundamentalism and massive assaults against democracy."},{"title":"Applied Media Literacy: Exploring and Producing Contemporary Multimedia","description":"In the 1974 political thriller by Alan J. Pakula The Parallax View, a journalist undertakes an aptitude test by a secret recruitment agency. Part of the test requires that he is exposed to a series of captioned images projected at increasing speed. One image displays a mother breastfeeding her baby with the caption “love” while another of a father holding the child bears the caption “father”. These are juxtaposed by images of Adolph Hitler and brutal images of war and death with the said captions alternating. The aforementioned sequence is indicative of a growing crisis of meaning in contemporary societies, especially in the postmodern Western world. At the same time, it highlights the fluidity of meaning and the power of the image and language in an age of ever-changing platforms of visibility (digital multimedia) and global interconnectedness (globalization). The proposed workshop takes this reality as its departure point in an effort to equip students with the knowledge and skills to comprehend the function and power of digital multimedia and images in contemporary capitalist societies. The students will be asked to look at and deliberate on a multitude of images – including moving images – ranging from popular TV entertainment (sitcoms, soap operas, wrestling, game shows) to news footage covering the “War on Terror” and ongoing sociopolitical crises and conflicts. At the same time, students will be asked to question and discuss the staggering presence of screens (computers, mobile phones, tablets) in their daily lives and their content, ranging from social and digital media (Facebook, Twitter, online news) to multi-platform TV viewing (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon TV). Considering the wide scope of the workshop, I aim to provide a hoslistic understanding of the power that images and media have in our daily lives, rather than a very specialized point of view. The class will thus be divided in four comprehensive categories: TV, cinema, journalism and digital media. Meetings will be divided into two parts. Classes will begin with a one-hour lecture that will provide students with theoretical background to foster a critical approach to images and media discourse. In particular, the lecture will draw on various works that students will be expected to read for the class. In the second hour, we will resort to a hands-on approach so as to directlty involve students in the production of meaning. To do so, they will be asked to display material that they have created (posters, short film scripts, ‘fake news’, communication plans for governments and organizations), drawing on the weekly theme and reading. The students will utilize theory in their effort to produce material that showcases how images and the media are powerful tools in conveying an intended meaning to an audience. For optimal use of time in this second part, students will first be divided into small groups. Each student will briefly present their work, the objectives they had and the strategy they resorted to to convey a message. Comparison between the various artifacts and peer reviewing between students will help them highlight how ‘efficient’ a strategy was and to unpack the theory(ies) underlying message-building. Finally, each group will recap to the entire class the conclusions they drew during their group work. This will allow the whole student cohort, with my help, to formulate an informed summary of the strategies used by the media to achieve their given goals. By the end of the semester, students will have obtained not only a solid understanding of the political and ideological implications of images and media in society, but also a measure of distance that allows them to go from passive spectators to critical thinkers of media."},{"title":"Significant Topics in Sociology : Gender","description":"In sociology, the so-called classical theory rarely incorporates an analysis of gender. Until quite recently, gendered power relations have been located at the margins of the discipline’s theoretical canon. Yet, gender has long structured social relationships and our ideas about them. The aim of this course is to demonstrate that gender is a powerful lens that applies to various fields of sociological thinking, from sociology of family to sociology of labour to sociology of the environment, and how it can be employed for empirical research. This course does not constitute a ‘specific’ course on gender. Instead, it is a general sociological course that incorporates gender-sensitive lens into the study of ‘bigger’ sociological questions, such as the reproduction of society through the institutions of family, social inequalities at work and at home, migration and globalisation, social movements, scientific and technological innovations, and planetary environmental degradation."},{"title":"The Law Drafting Process in Western Democracies","description":"The workshop allows students to get more familiar with the writing techniques of laws thanks to the review of the legislative process which implicates the participation of various political actors (Government, Parliament, Committees…). It will also focus on other writing skills that need to be developed in Legislature, such as the writing of motions of Impeachment and the submission of bills to judicial review. In a comparative perspective, the students will thus discover the different practices of legal writing, finishing with judicial review and the constitutional trial. Focus is made on French, UK and US Legislatures."},{"title":"International Criminal Law Through the Prism of Drug Policy","description":"Chapter one: Generalities Session 1 Overview of Drug Situation Session 2 Criminal Policy: Concept of Criminal Policy.

Digitalization has not changed the core principles that underlie journalism, yet it has allowed a terrific shift in terms of habits, capacities and expectations of news production and news consumption –and of course of business models–, but also major changes in news avoidance, inequality in accessing quality news (and its impact on democracy and participation), and trust in media and in news. In this course, which is intended mainly in a practical way, is aimed at understanding the birth and evolution of online journalism, its characteristics, and at assessing the quality of digital media on the Internet. Theoretical content is also provided in order to build practice on it. Hence, students will look for the best practices in international news coverage online through three main levels: company, messages, and user interaction."},{"title":"Art and Gender in Contemporary Spain","description":"This course provides a dynamic, multi-disciplinary introduction to Contemporary Art in Spain. A background on this specified field is not required. For this reason not only the main artistic events will be covered, but also some political, historical and cultural issues that might be relevant. Although this course is manly based on lectures and class debate, four visits to art centers and exhibitions will be also part of the course requirements. These visits will be made during class time and are equivalent to a usual in-class lecture. We will discuss recent classics as well as emerging artists, and we will cover a wide range of artistic practices, from photography to afterpop music, including installation art, performance art and comic art. Although the course offers several relevant clues to understand the historical context and particular conditions in Spain, it is also intended as a more general insight into contemporary artistic strategies and topics. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_artangender_F23_G1.pdf/f708af31-5e54-a142-6760-8f59f22f24ec?t=1695711422097"},{"title":"Barcelona the City and its History","description":"Once labeled by Newsweek magazine as the “coolest city in Europe,” Barcelona enjoys the reputation of a cosmopolitan city with a great international projection. Like all places, however, it is not without its complexities and contradictions. Behind a glossy and tourist-friendly façade, the city has a complex history. This course introduces the student to the city of Barcelona by studying its past and analyzing its present. This interdisciplinary course covers subject in history, geography, art, architecture, and urban planning. Materials include images, maps, academic and literary texts, videos, field studies, and documentaries. We will also discuss issues relevant to people living within the city of Barcelona today. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_bcnhisten_F23.pdf/7dc463cb-6ba1-dd50-725c-754a842c7652?t=1683102309097"},{"title":"Cinematic Creativity in Spain: Authorship, Industry, Politics","description":"The birth of cinema transformed the way we understand artistic creation. Film is a mechanically reproduced artwork without the aura of uniqueness that characterizes classical pieces (Benjamin, 1935). It emerges as a mechanical extension of the human body, an “artificial eye”. Film production is also automated: it is a paradigm of “creative industry” (Howkins, 2001). In many ways, cinema appears at the intersection of the joint creative effort of human talent, industry, science & technology. This course will study various aspects of creativity and authorship in examples from Spanish cinematography. Early theoretical and practical approaches to filmic creation, the development of new artistic professions and creative labor organization in the film industry will be studied through Spanish silent cinema and the growth of CIFESA studios (1932-1961). There will be an introduction to the debates over the status of film’s leading creators, looking at producers, directors, and writers from this period. The political dimension will be presented through the creative ways in which filmmakers eluded Franco’s censorship. Since the 1960s and the rise of modern cinema, the highly influential French auteur theory favors the director as a film’s main creator. The course will introduce Spanish auteurs from the modern period (Camus, Picazo) and present critiques of the director’s importance, implicit in works of postmodern filmmakers (Almodóvar, Medem). The challenges faced by contemporary auteurs (Lacuesta, Sorogoyen) at the side of recent ideas sharply opposed to the auteur theory that consider films as a result of collective creation (Sellors, 2007) or the audience as a creative force (Mayne, 2002). The work of Spanish experimental filmmaking platforms like “Authorless Cinema Collective”, as well as the creative design of contemporary Spanish cinematography’s cultural policies and initiatives that foster female creativity will be considered. This course will also have a creative component: students will make short films as group projects. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_cinematic_F23.pdf/725a1ded-e6c7-7de2-f242-09fc84e953d1?t=1681893770359"},{"title":"Collective Intelligence, Global Challenges and Planetary Wellbeing","description":"We live in a new era characterized by globalization and the digital revolution, and by the emergence of new planetary challenges and threats that require global, collective and effective solutions. These planetary challenges and threats include climate emergency, global health, nuclear security, global inequality, migratory movements, tax evasion, global terrorism, digital security and privacy, etc. All these challenges are global, complex, and interrelated. They need a response that is also global, intelligent and effective. An adequate management of them requires a holistic approach such as the United Nations’s framework of Sustainable Development Goals and UPF’s proposal for “planetary wellbeing”. This course will study how global institutions, as well as nation states, cities and others actors, can face global challenges like those mentioned above. Their responses will need to be creative and intelligent. This is why this course will focus on the new ways in which collective intelligence, crowdsourcing methods and public involvement in decision making in general can enhance the quality of global responses to these challenges. Students will be exposed to some successful practical examples of collective intelligence enhanced through new technologies, like the idea of Crowdlaw, which might combine data analysis, machine learning, AI, Blockchain and even virtual reality with the aim of improving public decision making. The course will also focus on the conditions under which international organizations, states and cities can make or contribute to make international legal decisions that might provide solutions to these problems in a way that preserves democratic legitimacy and justice. For that purpose, this course will combine the study of global governance, and new technologies with political philosophy, legal philosophy, international law and international relations. After being exposed to all these existing solutions, students will be asked to be creative and work collectively to learn from each other and to find the best solutions to the problems they choose to work in. Each student will have to work on a particular problem, but he/she will share with the rest of the class his/her work and proposed solutions and all students will help each other to refine their final proposals https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_collectiveintsol_F23.pdf/0e0eb540-392c-0eb0-ce98-3aa91a1d02ce?t=1683527972751"},{"title":"Ethics in a Globalization and Sustainability Context","description":"Although globalization and sustainability have become familiar terms, they are at cross purposes. The way globalization has been conducted with an emphasis on the economic sphere—international trade and cross-border investment flows, has created a series of crises that threaten the ethical values and beliefs of a sustainable society. The primary goal of a business is usually seen as making a profit, however, the path towards achieving this goal can, in many instances, create dilemmas regarding justice, equity and honesty. Ethics goes beyond what is or is not legal as it is concerned with the ethical reflection of what represents right and wrong behavior in a complex, dynamic, and global environment. On this course we will discuss ethical approaches to global issues that are enhanced by the process of globalization and increasing multiculturalism, e.g. the environment, global citizenship & governance, poverty and inequality, peace and conflict, human rights, health and the effects of technology among others. Because global issues are complex, this course is not about providing students with formulas for making decision-making easier; instead the ideas and frameworks introduced in this course are designed to actually make decision-making more difficult, but will help students to reason more effectively and develop their sense of responsible judgment. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_ethics_F23.pdf/3506f85a-63e5-fd9e-f833-b87041fb97f2?t=1681813613850"},{"title":"Gender-based Violence and International Protection of Human Rights","description":"It was as recently as 1992 that a UN Committee (the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) asserted that gender-based violence against women was a form of discrimination and a human rights violation and not just a private matter in which the State should not interfere. Since then, a number of instruments and mechanisms have been developed within the UN Human Rights System as well as in regional human rights’ protection systems to address such violence and, in recent years, to also include protection of other persons affected by gender-based violence, in particular, the LGBTIQ+ community. For this purpose, the historic evolution that led to frame gender-based violence as a human rights violation and analyze the existing instruments and tools available at the international level (both UN and regional) to ensure that states adequately address gender-based violence against women and LGBTIQ+ individuals will be reviewed. The course will focus on international binding instruments, including international conventions (both, general and specifically addressing gender-based violence) and jurisprudence from international courts, as well as non-binding instruments such as recommendations from specialized bodies and organs at the UN and regional levels. It will examine the existing mechanisms and procedures available at the regional and international levels for individual complaints or communications as well as for reports of wider situations of gender-based violence, and the developments to address gender-based violence in International Criminal Law, including the evolution in jurisprudence towards framing gender-based crimes as international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_genderbased_F23.pdf/1b12381d-a46f-bf28-3f0a-fbb6a9242fa3?t=1683282789753"},{"title":"Global Culture and Marketing of FC Barcelona","description":"European football (soccer) has become a major cultural vehicle in the global world, both in terms of economical impact and social influence. This course focuses on how this sport shapes the social, economical and cultural realms, and tries to interpret the different links between the game itself and the dimensions surrounding it: media coverage, aesthetic value, political targeting, public and corporate policies… In that context, FC Barcelona remains a unique case, studied in business schools as an example of global market branding, while passionately lived by millions of fans all over the world. Moreover, Barcelona city offers a privileged standpoint to better understand football as a growing issue within contemporary culture. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_globalcultureFCB_F23.pdf/606d6707-8828-c2bf-48de-fa0cac2f1c44?t=1681813614117"},{"title":"Literary texts: interpreting, dialoguing, creating","description":"The literary text is a good resource for the development of intercultural competences, as it allows the student to observe and confront the belief system of his/her own community with that of the language he/she is learning and to reflect on the different values and attitudes of both cultures in order to act appropriately in the target language. In this sense, the course aims to bring contemporary Spanish literature closer to the student, through the reading and analysis of a selection of literary texts of different genres (narrative, poetry and theater), to develop their interpretative and reading skills, and to acquire techniques and criteria to enhance and stimulate their creative capacity. From the study of the selected texts, social, cultural and historical issues that contribute to a better and more complete interpretation of them will be addressed, and critical thinking and autonomy will be fostered in relation to the readings that are carried out. The aim is not to reach a definitive interpretation of the texts analyzed, but to use them as a stimulus for the student to transmit ideas, feelings and emotions, and as a basis for reflection, reasoning and discussion in the classroom."},{"title":"The Global Governance of the Internet and of Future Emerging Technologies","description":"The course is aimed at analysing how the Internet and Future Emerging Technologies are governed at a global level. In a continuously evolving context, the course is an invitation to reflect about different initiatives at the international level aimed at addressing some of the key challenges traditionally associated to these technologies (including issues of privacy and data protection, limitations on freedom of expression and content moderation online, as well as the social and environmental impact of digital technologies). In this sense, the course will focus on understanding the role that non-State actors (such as international governmental and non-governmental organisations, non-state public organisations, private companies, and the broader global civil society) play in these initiatives as well as the models of governance that each of these players support and promote when it comes to the governance of the Internet and of Future Emerging Technologies. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_governance_F23+%281%29.pdf/f6b6024b-5aea-749f-bf95-f2d2fa4cf9fa?t=1693479978691"},{"title":"Globalization, Human Development and Sustainability: Politics and Policies in the Framework of the 2030 Agenda","description":"How globalization redefines wealth and opportunities around the world? Is globalization a force for good or does it create opportunities only for a small minority? Inequalities have increased and cooperation has proved not to be very effective. Indeed, after having spent in the last five decades more than 2,3 trillion dollars, the path towards sustainable human development seems to be still full of obstacles and constraints. The course aims at introducing students to the most salient aspects of the debate around globalization, development and international cooperation. Classical views on development will be contrasted with more contemporary approaches such as: the Agenda 2030 framework, no-one living behind principle, whole-of-society-approach, multilevel governance and multi-stakeholder participation. The course combines analytical tools and categories stemming from political science, international relations, economic geography, European Integration studies, public policies and development economics. By applying interactive and participatory teaching methodologies, the course will stimulate student’s active involvement and participation all across the sessions. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_globdevelop_g2_F23.pdf/3f1d1d95-e0a7-05aa-0a25-ea32a2e12dd1?t=1683271287750"},{"title":"Great Ideas that Have Shaped our World: From the Axial Age to the Artificial Intelligence Revolution","description":"This course builds on the idea that ethical-religious, philosophical, and scientific imagination is vitally important in the development of human societies. It focuses on key religious, ethical-political, and scientific innovative ideas that have revolutionized and shaped society from antiquity to modern times. The course deals not only with understanding the context of the emergence of these ideas, but also their impact on the contemporary world and mentality. It will begin with the “Axial Age” (Karl Jaspers), characterized by a series of ethical-religious, scientific and philosophical innovations from China to Ancient Greece, and move chronologically to the Renaissance, Enlightenment and the current digital and robot revolution. The substantive and methodological approach is not Eurocentric and reductionist, but rather global and interdisciplinary. The course adopts a problem-solving approach based on understanding why and how new and creative ideas – from Buddhism and monotheism to Marxist materialism, genetical engineering and quantum physics – answer different types of challenges and queries – existential, epistemic, or ethical-political. The classes are structured through lectures and open discussions based on texts and videos/documentaries. The emphasis is on discussing primary sources (e.g. texts by Confucius, I. Newton, Ch. Darwin, S. Freud, A. Einstein) and relevant videos/documentaries, with the aim of understanding revolutionary ideas, their relevance and their long-standing influence on current practices and societies. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/greatideas_F23.pdf/125ba1ab-4a9e-a211-b69f-90636d0db374?t=1681813614382"},{"title":"Innovation and the Law. How Technology Changes the Legal System","description":"The course aims to give the students a general overview of the core legal institutions, while introducing the students to the main legal problems attached to the new technologies. The reading assignments and the classroom discussions will illustrate how technology changes traditional legal concepts and the way in which the legal rules are applied. A basic introduction to contracts, property, torts from a comparative perspective will be followed by an explanation of the relevant technologies and their implications in the legal understanding of the core legal topics. In addition, the course will focus on the current trends of the harmonization process in order to give a common response to technology challenges providing a general overview of the problems arising from the interaction between technology and the law. The general legal analysis of contracts, torts and property will be applied to the challenges posed by smart and relational contracts, the interaction between big data and competition law, the internet of things and the application of products liability and insurance to fully automated devices. Sharing and collaborative economy formulas will also be analyzed in the course. https://www.upf.edu/documents/235672946/269802014/BaPIS_innovationlaw_F23.pdf/6346677f-420f-d5f3-b496-f9cc43e62db1?t=1683185810882"},{"title":"Laws of Creativity. The Impact of Legal Systems on Artistic Practices and Other Creative Endeavors","description":"How does the law affect creativity? Is the law actually hindering creativity or is instead encouraging it? Are such impacts just quantitative or also qualitative? Answering these questions requires examining various branches of the law. Intellectual property is for many the best mechanism that legal systems have to foster creativity and innovation. However, intellectual property also limits many creative processes, especially those that build upon previous works and cultural traditions. Finding the optimal trade-off between those two forces is one of IP’s main goals. Regulations on freedom of expression, censorship, contract law, zoning, and cultural sponsoring, among others, and their enforcement by public authorities can also impact artists’ creative choices in many ways. This course aims at providing an in-depth discussion on the ways law regulates creativity and affects the content of works. One of the main goals of the course is to examine whether legal systems are neutral to different forms of creativity or if they discriminate among forms (for instance, if stand-alone creativity is preferred to sequential creativity, if high culture is treated differently than low culture, or if a male-stereotyped creativity is supported). The course focuses mostly on intellectual property law and freedom of expression. Other areas of law such as contract law, zoning law, and tax law will be also presented. Students will be provided with a theoretical overview of those areas to understand their rules and doctrines and how they affect creativity. The course will also offer the discussion of several case studies, including, among others, tattoos, memes, graffiti art, music sampling or content creativity in social media and other online platforms.

However, a broader definition which understands globalization as an economic, social, and cultural process of growing communication, interdependence, and change suggests that it dates back to the early modern era, when the Atlantic expansion of Europe in particular produced ever closer links of growing intercontinental interdependence. This “first globalization” led to the exploitation of entire peoples and the forced migration of others, as well as to different forms of contact among diverse cultures, which gave rise to a wide range of extra-local mixtures, hybrids and conflicts. In order to understand these and other transformations which led to the hegemony of the West in the nineteenth century, this course analyzes a lengthy process whose main protagonists were, first, Portugal and Spain, followed by the north Atlantic states. It will be seen that among the latter Great Britain emerged as the leading power beginning in the later eighteenth century, the period that saw the decisive changes that led to the Industrial Revolution."},{"title":"Health Psychology","description":"Specific Objectives of the Course: 1.

Migration is a powerful mechanism in the social and economic dynamics both of migrants themselves and of the places that are involved in migration. At the regional level, for example, we observe that human capital is an increasingly important determinant of economic development. At the individual level, migration may be a means to improve your socio-economic position, for example when searching for a new job, or perhaps when running from harsh political circumstances. Migration thus plays a key role in the lives of people as well as for the regions people live and work. Understanding the process of migration is therefore key in understanding the socio-economic development of people and places. This course is dedicated to the mutual relationship between migration and the economic and social development of people and places. It offers theories to understand why people migrate and the outcomes of migration. At the same time, theories that highlight the role of human capital and migration in regional development are explored. In addition, the course aims at providing the latest research and trends about migration flows within and between countries as well as the changing economic and social framework in which migration takes place."},{"title":"Global Business History (Faculty of Economics and Business)","description":"Describe the central role the business firm has played in modern economic development Provide answers to questions as how the nature of business firms has developed over time and how that is related to broader economic, social and technological changes taking place simultaneously Provide answers to questions, such as why do firms differ between countries, and what is the role of the state, and the international market in explaining these differences? Critically discuss these explanations and formulate clear and focused arguments in a written essay Why are some countries rich and others poor? The course Global Business History studies this question by focusing on the historic evolution of the business firm, a key factor in economic development. A study on the determinants of successful entrepreneurship in the past may help to understand why we observe the things we see today, such as the cross-country income differences mentioned above. Often, a roadmap of the development of the firm in years, decennia and perhaps even centuries before provides insight in today’s state of affairs. In the words of Winston Churchill, the further backward one looks, the further forward one can see. Therefore, this course explores the history of the business firm in an international perspective.

If we look closer at what this spirituality entails, we often find convictions about a higher meaning of life, about the place of the human being in the cosmos, about the sacredness of the world, about hidden powers in nature, and about modern physics and biology as not conflicting with spiritual experience. In this course, we will reconstruct the genealogy of these ideas and practices, which have emerged from a philosophical, religious, scientific, and allegedly “secular” setup during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We will trace the impact of these discourses on new spiritual practices from the 1950s through today. Such practices include nature-based spiritualities, Paganism, astrology, shamanism, and related currents that have sometimes — and misleadingly — been called “New Age.”"},{"title":"People, Place and Culture","description":"1.

Requirements: In the course we will often consider deviations from mainstream models of economics, so knowledge of introductory microeconomics is helpful."},{"title":"GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY (mod.1+2)","description":"At the end of the course, students will be able to analyze the main differences between world economies in dealing with social and economic change and its implications in terms of market integration and individual inequality, knowing how to recognize the main trends in the global distribution of income and wealth in the short and long run. Finally, the ability to recognize the links between global integration, technological change and regional and individual inequality will be acquired. The course will provide analytical skills at a theoretical and, above all, empirical level, through the study and development of frontier research on the aforementioned topics, and the use of historical and contemporary data for the socioeconomic analysis of inequalities. CONTENTS The course includes two integrated parts. In the first, a long-term overview will be offered on globalization, understood as the global integration of the markets of goods, labor, and capital, and on global inequality, analyzed as inequality between countries and within them (individual inequality). We will then focus on the so-called First globalization (c. 1850 – 1914) studying its benefits (economic convergence between different regions and countries of the world) but also social, economic and political costs, such as the impact on individual inequality, analyzing winners and losers in the globalization process. Ultimately, we will analyze how the economic, social and political dynamics linked to the First Globalization favored a return to protectionism at the end of the nineteenth century and the affirmation of anti-immigration policies, analyzing the parallels with today’s situation and the implications of policy. In the second part of the course, the deceleration of productivity growth in advanced economies and the various interpretations of its causes will be illustrated, up to the thesis on the failure to spread the benefits of innovation. The geographical and regional economic dynamics linked to globalization (distance, technological proximity and related variety), the convergence/divergence trajectories between economies, and the implications of these dynamics at a social and political level will also be illustrated."},{"title":"LANGUAGE, SOCIETY AND IDEOLOGY","description":"The course is part of the educational offering of the Master in Public and Cultural Diplomacy aimed at strengthening students’ competence and sensitivity regarding the political, social, and cultural significance of language use, which is of fundamental importance in public and diplomatic contexts. Students will be trained to analyze the social function of language and the use of language to convey social meanings. They will become aware of the social factors influencing linguistic varieties. The focus will be on the phenomenon of diglossia, so-called “high” and “low” linguistic varieties in monolingual and bilingual communities. We will also study the concepts of “code-switching” and “code-mixing.” We will analyze cases of linguistic minorities migrating and adopting a new language, along with the economic and political factors that may encourage such a shift. We will examine the concepts of “linguistic vitality,” “linguistic landscape,” vernacular and standard language. We will then focus on the concepts of national and official language and the process that can lead a minority language to obtain the status of an official language. We will explore how defining a “linguistic area” is complex and in what sense “languages are not purely linguistic entities.” For the study of a speaker’s language choices, context is crucial. We will see how context can make a difference in the language we use, how the interlocutor influences the speaker, and what “audience design” is. We will focus on the phenomena of accommodation and divergence between speakers. We will analyze cases of non-hostile divergence, situations where convergence may have a cost, and instances of excessive convergence. We will also address some methodological issues related to the interview context and the so-called “Observer’s Paradox.” We will then examine kindness and its social and cultural dimensions, linguistic devices supporting conversation, interruptions, feedback, and gossip. We will also address the theme of linguistic construction of gender. Subsequently, we will closely observe the relationship between language and perception, how they mutually influence each other, and the major theoretical issues underlying their interaction. We will focus on the famous Whorf-Sapir hypothesis. We will explore how language can either cut nature at its joints or organize it into concepts. We will also study the cognitive cost of losing a language. At this point, we will move on to the first three chapters of Peter Garrett’s book, “Attitudes to Language.” We will see how attitudes permeate our daily lives, their public articulation, and their often unconscious nature, what it means to frame something through language, and how we project an image through words. Finally, students will deepen their knowledge of metaphors as linguistic tools that can play a role in our social and cultural navigation. To this end, we will study some chapters of “The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought.” We will start with the neural theory of metaphors, then move on to analyze how metaphors can shape our theories, in what sense their pervasiveness might hinder theoretical grasping of reality, and how becoming aware of the assumptions and epistemic limits of the metaphors we use is crucial for the theorist. Students will also see how the metaphors we live with, and about, often come from bodily experience and culture, and how metaphors can be present not only in spoken language but also in gestures."},{"title":"CULTURAL HERITAGE AND CULTURAL RELATIONSHIPS","description":"Requirements: basic knowledge of the main historical events would help the students to put in context what the teacher will tell. However, the teacher will dedicate a lecture to give the necessary data.

EC competition law goals are twofold: the promotion of integration between the Member states and the promotion of effective competition. The course will focus on the latest goal, which might be termed “the economic goal”. Main provisions of EC law (and policy) are contained in the articles 101 and 102 of the treaty on the functioning of European Union (TFEU) and in the Merger regulation. They aim at regulating firms’ behaviour in order to promote competition considering that competition improves economic welfare. The European competition law development shows a “more and more economic approach” which had an impact on the application of competition law at the European level. The main consequence that has arisen from making economic reasoning more explicit in the decision- making process has been to promote competition by protecting the competition process rather than protecting competitors. A given business practice that makes more difficult for one firm’s rivals to compete does not therefore imply that the competitive process is being harmed. Thus, in spite of the existence of competition rules, each case is different since business conducts under investigation give rise to different effect depending on the market conditions. The course will thus focus on the economic analysis of firms’ behavior alleged to be anti-competitive conduct in order to explain European making decision process in competition cases. The course is divided in 2 parts: the first introduces the objectives of competition law and the main concepts required to understand those objectives (3 sessions), and the second part covers the main applications of competition law: coordinated practices (Art. 101), unilateral practices (Art.102, Abuse of dominant position), and regulation of mergers that are or could be detrimental to competition."},{"title":"International marketing","description":"In today’s market, almost any product can be transformed into a commodity as competitors copy successful products.

Debating Responses to Contemporary Social Challenges","description":"The analysis of social problems is a key area of sociological and criminological investigation. However, not all problems experienced by individuals are recognised as social problems by society and not all publicly recognised social problems are also discussed by policy-makers. Why do some issues come to be regarded as social problems ? Is this always because there is clear evidence the issues are socially harmful? What else affects this process? And why are only some of these issues taken up by policy makers? Are the public policy responses to the identified problems always appropriate? This course seeks to address these questions by exploring both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, it will focus on poverty, migration and youth crime (?). How have these issues been understood as problems and in what ways has this understanding affected the public policy response?"},{"title":"Introduction to Probability and Statistics","description":"The theory and methods of Statistics play an important role in all walks of life, society, medicine and industry. They enable important understanding to be gained and informed decisions to be made, about a population by examining only a small random sample of the members of that population. For example, to decide whether a new drug improves the symptoms of a disease in all those diagnosed as having the condition (the population), a clinical trial might be undertaken in which a sample of people who receive the new drug is compared with a sample receiving no active treatment. Such statistical inferences about a population are subject to uncertainty – what we observe in our particular sample (or samples) may not hold for the whole population. Probability theory and statistical distributions are needed to quantify this uncertainty, and assess the accuracy of our inference about the population. This module aims to lay foundations in probability and distribution theory, data analysis and the use of a statistical software package, which will be built upon in later modules."},{"title":"Linear Algebra","description":"Linear maps on vector spaces are the basis for a large area of mathematics, in particular linear equations and linear differential equations, which form the basic language of the physical sciences.

But, when they study economics, they find that their introductory course is arid and theoretical, and designed primarily for students who want to study the subject as their major. The result is that students from other disciplines often find themselves studying a quantitative and analytical economics module that is only minimally social in content and downplays the insights of other disciplines, or a social or business-oriented module that gives them little training in modelling, or in quantitative scientific methods. In contrast, this module draws on the work of the global CORE team to offer students who are not specialist economists an in-depth introduction to economics and the global economy that is both analytical and real-world. The module focuses throughout on evidence on the economy, from around the world, and from history. It is motivated by questions — how can we explain what we see? This module is targeted at UG students who are not taking economics as a major subject but who want to develop their analytical skills and learn how to use economics to understand and articulate reasoned views on some of the most pressing policy problems facing our societies."},{"title":"Environmental Management","description":"Introducing the concept of sustainable environmental management: environmental problems, their causes and sustainability; biodiversity; water resources and water pollution; energy resources; air pollution, climate change and ozone depletion; solid hazardous waste; food security; environmental management systems.

Subsequent topics include: party systems, electoral systems, government formation, inter-party competition, intra-party competition and devolution. Students should be able to identify what the fundamental differences are between Britain and Ireland in terms of how political life is organised and how citizens think and act politically. Students should also become familiar with the fundamental elements that are shared by the two islands. Students should gain an understanding of what it is about the politics of Britain and Ireland that is unique in a comparative European context. They should also gain insight into the elements of political life on these islands that is common across our European neighbours."},{"title":"International Relations","description":"This module sets out to help students understand and analyse the development of International Relations as a discipline through its theories and major issues. The key theories of international relations are examined, from Realism, through Marxism to contemporary approaches such as Poststructuralism, with a focus upon how each one criticizes and responds to the others revealing its strengths and weaknesses. Within this, major issues of international relations will be explored from a theoretical and conceptual perspective, such as the balance of power, peace, international society, norms and gender. Finally, the course turns to modern challenges to the discipline of International Relations, such as International Political Economy, the spread of Globalization, and contemporary concerns with security and the War on Terror. The module therefore considers how well International Relations is responding to these challenges."},{"title":"The Northern Ireland Conflict and Paths to Peace","description":"What caused the Northern Irish conflict? What factors sustained it? What role did world leaders, paramilitaries, clergy and local politicians play in progressing the peace process?

Global temperatures are rising; heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense; wildfires are burning through vast swathes of forest; ice sheets and glaciers are melting; permafrost is thawing; sea levels are rising; rainfall is becoming more intense and causing increased flooding in some places, yet also becoming more seasonally sporadic and causing increased drought in other places. All the while, the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have withdrawn from international pledges to curb emissions (USA) and grown their economies through the rapid expansion of fossil fuels (China). This module explores this complex myriad of issues, ranging from the physical scientific basis of climate change to the human response in adapting to and mitigating climate change at the international and individual level. Among the range of hard and soft skills acquired, students will have the opportunity to apply technical climate modelling skills in the production of a report and will also gain experience in communicating complex scientific ideas to a general audience in the production of a portfolio."},{"title":"Human Geography, Society, Power and Culture","description":"The twenty-first century world that we all inhabit and its ‘human geographies’ is not just a product of the ‘modern age’. Rather, the world as we know it today is the result of diverse social, cultural, political and economic processes, of both gradual change and of occasional revolutions, occurring over many centuries, and ongoing still. This module attempts to make sense of these human geographies of the modern world by analysing three important and interconnected geographical themes: specifically, (1) globalism, and past and present local-global connections between individuals and societies; and; (2) geopolitics and the changing relations between regions and nation states (3) the changing scales and practices of everyday life in a globalised world. In addition to developing your geographical understanding of the modern world, the module seeks to develop key study and research skills to prepare you for more advanced study in levels two and three"}],"intakeStatistics":{}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/s87-university-of-bristol/","name":"University of Bristol","available":true,"location":"Bristol, United Kingdom ","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 09, 2024","end":"December 13, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":90,"det":"Not Accepted","regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Convincing stories? Numbers as evidence in the social sciences","description":"This course was delivered in Autumn 2023/24. This innovative unit, sponsored by the British Academy, Economic and Social Research Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for England, offers an introduction to quantitative social science, looking at how numbers are used (and abused) to create “stories” in the media, public policy, and in social and scientific debate. The aim of the unit is to prepare students for the sorts of methods and techniques they will encounter in their own discipline by discussing and debating the ideas and concepts that are used to create evidence in an uncertain world, and upon which decisions are made. The unit will encourage students to engage critically with research and debate in their own subject areas, placing them in a better position to learn quantitative skills. This is not a standard “textbook” class on statistics but a class about how and why numbers are used in society, encouraging students to consider how data may be used in their own research and studies. Students who have little or no interest in quantitative methods, who are anxious about mathematics or who simply want to get a head start in their studies are especially welcome on the unit."},{"title":"Quantitative Analysis in Management","description":"This course was delivered in Autumn 2023/24.

The module utilises advanced computer modelling tools available in Microsoft Excel to analyse and present quantitative data. It therefore develops practical skills in statistical and mathematical techniques commonly used in business and management decision-making. It draws on fundamental quantitative analysis and business statistics theories with contemporary computational skills to critically evaluate complex business problems and to cross-examine them through computer technologies. The module will also prepare students for the reading, comprehension and interpretation of original business and management research articles that are based on quantitative data and statistical analysis."},{"title":"Enquiry, Analysis and Communication","description":"This course was delivered in Autumn 2023/24.

Have you ever considered how deeply fairy tales are engrained in our modern world? From Disney’s fairy tale factory to fantasy worlds in video games, the plot lines and character types we are obsessed with all go back to fairy tales created by anonymous oral story tellers in the depth of time. In this unit we will explore major European fairy tale collections (e.g. Perrault, Grimm) and fairy tale motifs (e.g. Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella), highlighting their hybrid origins and their complex function in disseminating the values and conventions of the day. We will see how fairy tales migrate across Europe yet contribute to the consolidation of national identity, how they establish and subsequently dismantle gender norms, how they imagine the folk for an elite audience, and how they address both children and adults. We will trace the transformations of fairy tales across history and across media, including film adaptations, visual art, and advertisement. Finally we will ponder their enduring power in contemporary society: through a creative attempt to re-write and adapt a tale, we will experiment with their ability to embed contemporary concerns."}],"intakeStatistics":{}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/39-lancaster-university/","name":"Lancaster University","available":true,"location":"Lancaster, United Kingdom","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 16, 2024","end":"December 13, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":87,"det":"Not Accepted","regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Introduction to Business Intelligence and Analytics","description":"The module will cover the introductory topics of business intelligence, business analytics and business data science.

The module will rely on a spreadsheet software to support the computing and visualisation side and will teach the students useful approaches that will prove invaluable for their future studies and employment."},{"title":"Structuring Complex Problems","description":"Issues and problems in the complex world of management do not necessarily arise in a well structured form. People often do not know what they want or what is possible. Further, they may disagree about what they are trying to achieve and the means for arriving at their goals. Much thinking needs to be done in order to define an appropriate framework within which a useful analysis or project can be carried out. Various approaches have been developed in recent years to assist in this task, often referred to as problem structuring methods (PSMs). They are very practically oriented methodologies that typically involve the management team to help facilitate the structuring of complex situations. They place emphasis on dialogue to think through strategic problems, identify the salient issues, formulate goals and negotiate action plans. This course will introduce you to several PSMs and some of the process skills to use them."},{"title":"Entrepreneurship: Discovery and Practice","description":"The module will develop an introductory understanding of entrepreneurship as well as introducing you to experience a range of entrepreneurial skills (creativity, accessing resources, building networks and creating value) to enable to you understand key aspects of the entrepreneurial process.

In the first term students are introduced to the principles, practice and institutions of ‘liberal democracy’. Liberal democracy is the political and economic order that for many years has characterised life in ‘the West’. We begin the course by looking at the foundations of the liberal state, liberty and democracy, and examine their meaning, value and compatibility. We then explore two states that exemplify those principles (the UK and USA). Finally we will survey some of the institutions of liberal democracy which work within and beyond the state level (such as the European Union and the United Nations). The second term concentrates on the international system. First we look at different ways of understanding the world of states, a field of study known as International Relations. We then look at the application of these IR theories to the non-Western world, in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

c.1100 until the mid-14th century. The background to the coming of the Anglo-Normans to Ireland in 1169 and the impact they had on the landscape are discussed in depth in the first part of the course. Themes for this section of the course will include the role of castles, the manorial economy, trade, the foundation of villages, rural boroughs and towns by mostly English immigrants and the growth of certain cities. Dispersed settlement in Anglo-Norman parts of eastern Ireland will also be explored. In particular, in the first part of the course, the interplay between castle, town and countryside in Anglo-Norman Ireland is examined in detail. It must also be remembered that large parts of Ireland remained in some way under the control of Irish (Gaelic Irish) princes and lords. The Norman conquest in Ireland in the years after 1169 was only partial, unlike England in 1066 which saw the complete takeover of that country by William the Conqueror. Lectures in this section of the course will examine the nature of Irish settlement in the period under review and will argue that while there was much change, continuity from the pre-Norman early medieval period was seen too. Themes in this part of the course will include the late use of crannogs, ringforts, the Irish adoption of moated sites as princely residences and native agricultural practices. The course will also deal with the changes of the 14th century and the virtual collapse of the Anglo-Norman colony across large parts of Ireland at this time.

It addresses how Insular art and monastic culture was affected by events in Irish history such as the arrival of the Anglo-Normans in the 12th century and the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. The impact of antiquarianism and Celtic Revivalism in the 19th and 20th centuries in reviving awareness and interest in early Irish art is a major theme in the course, as is the notion of an ‘Irish Imagination’ in modern Irish art. Setting these within international contexts, the course analyses how these major manifestations of Irish art have contributed to and challenged notions of Irish cultural identity. The course includes site visits to major museums and galleries in the city of Dublin and to the Irish Folklore collection in UCD."},{"title":"Discovering Ireland's Landscape","description":"This module is intended for students new to Ireland and so largely unfamiliar with Irish archaeology and indeed Irish history. It aims to show how the Irish landscape can be read as a document to reveal many clues about Irish identity, whether that be ancient, medieval or modern. The module is focused on the idea of heritage: cultural landscape as a key element of Irish heritage. It is not based on traditional classroom lectures but on on fieldtrips, supported by materials available through our Virtual Learning Environment. But the best way to understand a landscape is to visit it, thinking and reading about it in advance and then thinking and reading about it again having experienced it. Two fieldtrips are normally part of this module, both concentrating on ancient and medieval landscapes within reach of Dublin by coach."},{"title":"Intro to Celtic Civilization","description":"This introductory module provides students with an overview of the origins, languages, literatures and mythologies of the Celts from prehistoric to medieval times. It forms a solid foundation from which students can progress to study the legacy of the Celts in greater detail at stages 2 and 3. The first half of the module begins with a survey of the main periods of Celtic archaeology and then considers how the Celts were portrayed by Classical Greek and Roman authors, our only written sources for the history of ancient Celtic Europe. Following this, English translations of legal and historical texts composed in Ireland from the seventh century onwards are drawn upon to build up a picture of life in the medieval Celtic world, considering topics such as the structure of early Irish society and the role of women. In the second half of the module, students will be introduced to the main genres of early Irish literature. This rich tradition will complement insights gained in the first half of the module. Students will focus on reading texts within the contemporary medieval context and will become familiar with the diversity of the early Irish literary tradition. The module will also address recent scholarship in relation to the interpretation of the relevant literature. Following an examination of approaches and sources, the module will focus on selected genres. One approach categorises the literature into four main sections. These are: The Ulster Cycle, the Mythological Cycle, the Fenian Cycle and the Cycle of the Kings. Students will also examine particular tale types involving voyages, death, love and other central themes. All texts will be read in translation, supported by critical reading, and no previous knowledge of a Celtic language is required. Beginners’ modules in medieval Irish and Welsh are also available for those wishing to study the languages of the primary sources."},{"title":"Vikings in the Celtic World","description":"This course will consider the Viking experience of the Celtic-speaking lands and how the Vikings, through both confrontation and collaboration, had a transformative impact on that world between c. 780-1020. The Vikings were largely a silent people and it is largely through the eyes of those they encountered ‘peoples who were already literate’ that we first get to know them. Many of our enduring images of the Vikings are based on sources from the Celtic world, and some of the earliest and most complete accounts of the initial Viking raids are found in the Irish annals. As the Vikings become a permanent presence in these lands, the Celtic and Norse views of the spiritual, heroic and economic world intersected and, at times, collided. We will look at the manner in which the Vikings are treated in literature and how this changes over time. We will trace the survival of rituals and beliefs brought from Scandinavia as exemplified by the decorated slabs and burials on the Isle of Man, where legends from Norse mythology feature on Christian crosses and a warrior was buried with a sacrificed slave. There were personalities, both Norse and Celtic, who straddled both worlds, and many of these men and women were nurtured in both traditions and reflect the enduring and transforming contacts made through intermarriage, fosterage and political alliances. The emergence of new dynasties and kingdoms is a product of the special circumstances of this period and we will consider how they arise and what their impact was on the wider Norse and Celtic worlds. Towns develop in the west and the north as a result of the Vikings’ new raiding/trading activities, and the connections between the contemporary developments of Dublin, Waterford and Limerick in Ireland and Kaupang, Birka and Hedeby in Scandinavia will be surveyed. This multifaceted course will provide students with a clear understanding of this fascinating and dynamic period in the history of the Norse and Celtic worlds."},{"title":"Kings and Heroes of Early Irl","description":"The Ulster Cycle tales are among the best-known narratives of Early Irish literature (c. 700-1200 AD). The tales depict the heroic society of pagan Ireland and the rivalry for supremacy between Ulster and Connacht. We will study, in translation, not just the centre-piece of the cycle (The ‘Táin’ or ‘Cattle Raid of Cooley’), but also other major and minor tales, which offer an introduction to the wide variety of themes, genres, and literary styles of one branch of this uniquely early literature. Among the most attractive and accessible of the Early Irish tales are those dealing with the lives of legendary or early historical kings and heroes, such as Cormac mac Airt, about whom many tales have survived. We will read these sagas in translation, to discover how legendary and historical kings are presented as admirable or otherwise, what the desirable characteristics of an ideal king were, and how the demands of kingship were reconciled with the king’s human needs. More generally we consider what were the pressing concerns of the social and political ruling elites of Early Ireland, and how how they were encoded and explored in a memorable literature."},{"title":"UCD Gamelan Ensemble 3","description":"This module provides an opportunity for students to become familiar with the art music tradition of Central Java by performing in the gamelan ensemble. The core focus of the module is on traditional Javanese forms and techniques, which students will become familiar with through practical experience with the various instruments and vocal parts that make up the gamelan. Classes will include regular discussion of the core concepts of gamelan music theory. There will also be an opportunity for students to compose and arrange new music for the ensemble. The module culminates in a end-of-trimester concert. Students will be evaluated based on an ongoing assessment of their progress throughout the term, and on their performance in the final concert."},{"title":"Contemporary Ireland On Stage","description":"This course examines new Irish theatre from the 1980s forward, with particular emphasis over the past twenty-five years, during a time of profound economic and social change. The disintegration of a unified national consciousness is reflected on Irish stages, and the proliferation of forms, themes, and styles signals trans-national concerns, urban consciousness, recreation of ‘traditional’ images and themes, and an interrogation of narrative, identity, and empathy."},{"title":"Introduction to Irish Studies","description":"This interdisciplinary module introduces students to a variety of questions, methods, and concepts underlying Irish Studies. A central theme of the lectures examines the processes through which identity is constructed through time. The course material raises a series of provocative and stimulating questions about concepts of Ireland and Irishness. This introductory module incorporates themes and methods from a broad range of related disciplines including history, archaeology, literature, film, art, music, sport, politics and folklore. The intersection between digital resources and traditional humanities research methods is explored through specified coursework. Active learning will be incorporated through reports on cultural site visits and reviews of cultural events. The aims of the course are as follows: 1) To introduce students to an understanding of the breadth of cultural and historical knowledge and perspectives on ‘Ireland’ and ‘Irishness’; 2) To enable students to grasp the complex and dynamic ways in which Ireland and Irishness have been conceptualised; 3) To facilitate students’ engagement with the field of Irish Studies; 4) To develop students’ writing skills, research skills, digital competence and cultural awareness."},{"title":"Children's Literature","description":"This module will explore a range of children’s literature by an eclectic set of writers from different cultural and historical contexts, surveying the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

By the end of the course, through close reading and analysis, students will be able to demonstrate a knowledge of major children’s authors, identify different categories of children’s literature, and illustrate an understanding of how these works reflect key social, political and cultural issues."},{"title":"Contemporary Irish Writing","description":"What distinguishes contemporary Irish writing? What are its chief thematic preoccupations and formal innovations? Who are its leading authors, what are their chosen subjects and who were their influences? How are contemporary Irish literary works received by their readers, nationally and internationally, and how can the ongoing diversity in literary texts, and in readers’ reactions, be studied, and interpreted? Is contemporary writing defined by its relevance, its artistry, or its socio-political concerns? How do writers compose and structure their works? This module will introduce readers to a range of contemporary Irish writings, spanning non-fiction, the novel, short stories and poetry, closely examining the choice of theme, the significance of form, and the nature of the works’ impact. In analysing the depiction of contemporary Irish urban and rural society in contemporary fiction, we will engage with ongoing debates concerning the function and importance of literary representation in the context of social crisis and change. The interrogation of irishness and identity in the course texts will be examined as will writers’ preoccupation with the transnational and the global. Workshop discussions, supporting the core lectures, will also examine how these contemporary writings have been received to date by readers and critics, and trace the ongoing processes whereby the reputations of texts and their writers are formed and shaped.

Digital Media and Everyday Experiences examine the uses and social consequences of the internet, social media, games and virtual reality. It analyses how digital technologies are socially shaped, reshaped, experienced and consumed. The module explores the dynamic interaction between the ‘logics’ and values of new and old media and the enduring cultural norms that shape the processes of localisation, appropriation, and domestication. During the module, students will develop an appreciation of the range of experiences affected by digital media, including the increasing expansion of life online, the growing intimate relations between life online and off and global divisions of labour. Students will investigate daily routines that often go unnoticed in the discussion of media such as media devices and digital objects, e-waste, digital economy and racial/gender bias in algorithms. Throughout, the module will be attentive to issues of gender, race, sexuality, and other categories of sameness and difference related to media use."},{"title":"Sociology Health & Inequality","description":"The intersection of health and inequality is a core concern of any society. Who has access to adequate healthcare and at what cost is a fixture of social and political debate, permeating recent elections in Ireland, the Brexit vote and the expansion of private health insurance under “Obamacare” in the US. To the extent that affluence and relative deprivation determine the health of a society, the implication for health of economic and social inequality is clear. In other words, it is no accident that health disparities are intimately related to other forms of inequality such as income and, in particular, wealth. This module intends to provide a theoretical lens through which the link between health and inequality more broadly can be understood and interrogated. Students will explore the core theoretical models underpinning how sociologists understand (1) the social determinants of health, (2) the two-way street of health and wealth, (3) the role of public policy in the provision of healthcare and (4) the intersection of health and social mobility. Throughout, an effort will be made to link abstract theory with concrete examples. Given that foundational work in health inequality emerged from comparing multiple country contexts, an international comparative perspective will be maintained. The intention is for each student to leave the classroom with the ability to understand at the macro- and micro-level how inequality determines health and vice versa."},{"title":"Art and Society","description":"Is art important? What does the place of art tell us about society? Would it matter if all art and all places of art – galleries, cinemas, concert halls, libraries, theatres, live music venues, etc. – disappeared? Why? Is there something about making art or about enjoying art that tells us something about what it means to be a human being? What happens when we watch a good film, see a powerful painting, or are moved by a new piece of music? How is art produced by different groups of people received differently? In this module we look for answers to these and related questions through an examination of the work of European philosophers predominantly from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The aim of the module is twofold: firstly, to give students a broad overview of the history of recent European thinking on art and its relationship to society. Secondly, to provide students with the conceptual tools to articulate and interrogate their own views of art. Students are strongly encouraged to bring their own examples to class, to ask questions, and to reflect on their own experiences of art works as either producers or consumers."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":135,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.12,"upperBound":3.98},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":98,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":85,"upperBound":150}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.39,"upperBound":3.88},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":135,"upperBound":150}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":84,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.22,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":100,"upperBound":155}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.55,"upperBound":3.95},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":130,"upperBound":150}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/33-university-college-cork/","name":"University College Cork - National University of Ireland","available":true,"location":"Ireland","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 01, 2024","end":"December 23, 2024"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":80,"det":120,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Digital Humanities: Theories and Concepts I","description":"This module will introduce students to the fundamental concepts of the Digital Humanities.

The module is organised along the following three themes, using UK and international examples: Changing Cities: we will discuss the changing physical form of cities into vast metropolitan regions. We discuss the various layers of urban analysis ranging from the nuclear city to mega city regions or megalopolises, comprising several metropolitan regions. The interaction between transport and land use receives specific attention, leading to mass regional urbanisation. The changing urban form raises questions about strategic planning and metropolitan governance. Urban and Regional Development: Cities have undergone an urban renaissance over the past decades. Globalisation is the cause both of a deep urban crisis of the 1970s and the formation of world cities in which capital and economic activity is concentrated. Social and Environmental Challenges: The current urbanisation process goes along with two fundamental challenges. Climate change has resulted in increased vulnerability and a need to mitigate its causes and adapt to an increase in extreme weather events.

Psychology is the science of the mind. It is a science because it aims to explain the greatest number of facts with the fewest number of assumptions, its hypotheses should be falsifiable by empirical tests, and its theories are connected to other sciences. The relevance of Psychology is very important to everyday life. This introduction to psychology will touch on some of the classic controversies including nature and nurture, the relationship between brain and mind, different approaches to understanding mental health, and how we process, store and use information about ourselves and other people. The approach embraces the diversity of perspectives within the discipline including experimental, cognitive, and developmental psychology, as well as biology and philosophy."},{"title":"Psychology in the Media","description":"This module introduces all of the main areas of contemporary psychology: cognitive, social, health and developmental. In doing so, it addresses common misconceptions about psychology: eg ‘You know what I’m thinking.’In turn, it describes how media influences programmes of scientific research, how public opinion is altered by media representations, and how Psychology has plotted a course through intense media interest and has ensured its strong scientific base.Central to the course is the discussion of how it is necessary to be critical of science in the media, and how common sense explanations need a basis in scientific evidence."},{"title":"International Politics","description":"This module starts by providing a brief overview of some key developments in world politics to date. Some of the most important concepts in International Politics are introduced in this context: the international system, war, sovereignty, collective security, inequality, and international organisations.

We also discuss some key structures and processes in this context, such as the changing character of war, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation."},{"title":"History of Psychology","description":"– Can there be a science of the mind?- If so, what should it look like? Since the nineteenth century, the most extraordinary range of answers has been given to these questions. The phrenologists, for instance, turned psychology into the study of bumps on the skull, on the view that your particular set of bumps would reveal your unique talents and character. The psychoanalysts turned psychology into the study of the unconscious, where, they said, your mind locks away wishes and impulses too shameful to be acted upon. The behaviourists turned psychology into the study of reactions to stimuli, attempting to show that your environment made you who you are and, if changed, could remake you.- How did these different understandings of what psychology is come into being? – Why did each have its moment of popularity, only to be overtaken by a new answer? – Where does the truth lie? In this module we will be looking not just at a remarkable set of ideas about what psychology is, but at the people behind the ideas, from Darwin to Freud to Chomsky and beyond. Anyone curious to know more about the mind and its study will enjoy this module."},{"title":"Science & Society: An Ethical View","description":"Advances in science have profoundly changed how we view ourselves, how we view the world, and how we live in societies. Scientists are called on to tackle the biggest challenges facing us now, such as climate change and the Covid-19 crisis. This is because the scientific method is widely understood as the most reliable route to knowledge. Any negative effects from scientific advancement, such as the predicted disruption from widespread use of AI, are seen as necessary for progress. But are there limits to what scientific thinking can help us solve? Is more and better science always the answer? Why is it good to be scientific? Are there ever reasonable grounds for distrusting science?These kinds of questions are about the value, purpose, and ethics of science. Because they cannot be answered by the scientific method, they may rarely be considered by scientists themselves. This module – co-taught by scientists from the Chemistry school, and ethicists from the IDEA Centre, with expertise in online teaching methods – will allow you to explore the inter-relation between science and ethics."},{"title":"Beginners Italian","description":"Beginners Italian 10 credits is for students who have not previously studied Italian.

It begins with an interrogation of the way development practices and ideas are embedded in cultural contexts, and specifically how the development industry is historically and culturally entangled in Western conceptions of progress, rationality, and the individual. Against a view of culture as ‘tradition’ and an impediment to development we will examine different cultural conceptions of progress. This involves both alternate visions of future development as well as the negative impacts that development policies and interventions have on local people, communities and cultures. Questions of power and cultural relativism inevitably arise: what happens when different interests and commitments collide, and who or what determines the module development interventions take?"},{"title":"Global Cultures, Local Lives","description":"This module explores anthropology as an exciting, ‘living’ subject, alive to the concerns of different communities and populations living across the globe, and as cutting edge in terms of the research conducted by anthropologists at Sussex as they actively engage with issues of social, cultural and global transformation. This is accomplished through a module structure which revolves around 5 core themes considered central to the subject that capture anthropological thinking on the subjects of culture, identity and representation: kinship; self and body; economy as culture; religion and politics; and work on the global-local interface."},{"title":"Human Factors & Ergonomics","description":"This module provides a foundation of principles for human-centred design that will be relevant throughout your degree programme. Initially there is a focus on physical considerations, including a study of human limits for inclusive design. Later on people’s behaviour is considered and how design can help to address significant issues for society. We also consider contemporary adaptations that embrace social factors, including consumer behaviour and a services approach to design. Finally we adopt a global perspective and understand more about society in developing countries and how design can help to address concerns. Topics will include: introduction to human factors, ergonomics, anthropometrics, the senses, mock ups to evaluate ergonomic principles, designing a handheld object (anthropometrics, anatomy and physiology of the hand), consumer behaviour, inclusive design, design for a sustainable society, cradle to cradle approaches, taking a systems approach to design, research methods for understanding lifestyle and context of use, global issues and design concerns."},{"title":"Global Issues","description":"The module aims to offer an introduction to a range of contemporary issues in global politics. Each week deals with a different global issue (e.g. development, poverty, economic sanctions, terrorism, emerging powers, migration, environment etc). The exact themes vary each year to cover the latest developments and crises in global politics. Most sessions start with an introduction to the theme by the module convenor and are followed by class activities (group discussion, presentations, debates, simulation games etc). The introduction by the convenor does not replicate the ‘required readings’, but expands or offers a different view to these readings and the issues under discussion. Similarly, student presentations do not focus on required readings but aim to cover contemporary ‘case-studies’ related to the themes under discussion."},{"title":"News, Politics and Power A","description":"This module explores media and politics and, more broadly, the media and questions of power. It focuses on current affairs with a stress on news; although other forms of factual content (for instance TV docudrama, web blogs, broadsheet lifestyle spin-offs) are also covered. This module considers the role media can play in producing our understanding of the globalizing world in which we live. It asks how media frames, organises, and contextualises events, both as they take place, and in relation to the collective memories that emerge after the event. It also asks how the media themselves are managed, manipulated, and influenced â€“ variously by governments, media owners, professional newsrooms codes, and/or by public pressure. You will examine the role the media play in relation to the citizen and the state. It is through the optic of citizenship, particularly in relation to the public sphere, that questions concerning the power of the media are addressed. You will also explore how a wide range of media contribute to the maintenance or erosion of a democratic society and an informed citizenship."},{"title":"Historical Controversy","description":"This module introduces you to the study of history through the critical reading of a key historical text. In this way you will gain an understanding of the complexity of the historical record and an appreciation of a range of problems associated with the interpretation of evidence.

Through a study of how historians have formulated and deployed their arguments, you will begin to learn to deploy ideas and to shape your own historical arguments."},{"title":"Truth and Morality: The Meaning of Life","description":"In this module, you study the central issues of morality, examining both the kinds of considerations that might be appealed to in moral arguments, and the status of moral arguments themselves. What should we bear in mind when deciding whether to eat meat, or whether to help someone, or whether to fight a war? In what sense are the decisions we make right? How can a moral argument be a good argument? Are some people wiser than others? Is there any truth in moral relativism? You tackle these and related issues from a range of theoretical positions. Module learning outcomes Characterise some central positions in first-order ethics. Characterise some central positions in meta-ethics. Evaluate the familiar arguments for and against these central positions. Argue for the student’s own view of the philosophical issues raised in the module."},{"title":"Resistance Movements in Conflict & War","description":"Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this module will explore the concept of resistance within conflict and war. This will be achieved by investigating the intersection between violence, ethics, politics, social and economic issues, and human rights. These discussions will be grounded in a range of critical academic theories and concepts, including: resistance theory social movement theory other related issues around collective behaviour, rational choice theory and framing. To place this into real-world context, the module will focus upon different resistance movements throughout history who have ‘broken the law’ in order to achieve what they, and often others, deemed to be some type of positive social change. Module learning outcomes Demonstrate knowledge and critical understanding of positive social change as a concept. Demonstrate knowledge and critical understanding of empirical research on positive social change. Apply the theoretical concepts/frameworks covered in the module to empirical examples, in order to critically analyse these examples. Critically assess the competing arguments that challenge the definitions of positive social change."},{"title":"Language and Power","description":"This module examines the ways in which attitudes to language are underpinned by (socio)political values, and how power is exerted through language. Topics include the relationship between language and national identity and attitudes to foreign languages and multilingual practices. For instance, why do some states spend large amounts of money in an attempt to eradicate particular languages, while other spend equal amounts on trying to revitalise certain languages? We will look at attitudes to language at both the level of the individual and state legislation, using case-studies from a range of countries. We also examine instances of coercive and persuasive language. Module learning outcomes Identify how language ideologies underpin language policy. Investigate power-in-language in relation to a specific context Research and critically analyse the relationship between language and power."},{"title":"Art on Site: Place, Identity and Meaning","description":"Art on Site is concerned with the close analysis of works of art out on site rather than in the seminar room, along with the physical, cultural and social contexts in which art is produced and consumed. It provides you with an introduction to the rich and diverse opportunities available to study art in situ that Brighton and the surrounding area provides. The module is structured around a series of specific case studies, selected both to highlight some of Brighton’s main resources and to represent broader issues central to the study and understanding of Art History. Sites of Art will take in a wide selection of sites, ranging from those specifically designed to house and present works of art, such as museums and galleries, to buildings and spaces that serve alternative functions, such as churches and houses. The module will also pay close attention to art’s relationship to the built environment, looking at issues relating to architecture and planning. Module learning outcomes Demonstrate knowledge of underlying concepts in understanding the relationship between art and its geographical location. Demonstrate basic understanding of how relations between artist and patron are mediated through site-specific considerations. Demonstrate basic understanding of how the meanings of works of art can change according to their physical location. Demonstrate basic practical understanding of field-work study in the discipline."},{"title":"News, Politics and Power B","description":"This module explores media and politics and, more broadly, the media and questions of power. It focuses on current affairs with a stress on news; although other forms of factual content (for instance TV docudrama, web blogs, broadsheet lifestyle spin-offs) are also covered.

It also asks how the media themselves are managed, manipulated, and influenced â€“ variously by governments, media owners, professional newsrooms codes, and/or by public pressure. Finally the module is centrally concerned with the role the media play in relation to the citizen and the state. It is through the optic of citizenship, particularly in relation to the public sphere, that questions concerning the power of the media are addressed.

This will equip students with an understanding of the role of education in international development and develop critical, political and methodological perspectives."},{"title":"Global Climate Change","description":"This module takes an interdisciplinary view on the scientific basis of claims of global climate change, the human responsibility and the future implications of the change. In doing so it is largely based around theoretical and evidence based elements of climate science. Half of the module is dedicated to providing a sound basis for undergraduate level critical understanding of the science of contemporary climate change for the present-day and in the future. The other half provides the foundations for a critical understanding of the basis of future climate impacts."},{"title":"Reason and Argument","description":"The aim of this module is to help you to become reflective about the way arguments work by looking at a number of paradoxes. Paradoxes puzzle and perplex us. If you’re going to sort them out, you have to clearly lay out the arguments and assumptions that lie behind the puzzlement and perplexity. And doing that helps you to see how to analyse arguments more generally. You’ll see that most paradoxes have several solutions. Understanding the reasons in favour of different solutions will help you to see how arguments work, and how assumptions are often in play ones that you may not have thought about before."},{"title":"Comparative Public Policy","description":"Why do public policies differ from country to country? How can we explain these differences? Why are some governments more successful than others in solving particular policy problems? These are the key questions that will be explored in this introductory module to comparative public policy. The first part of the module explores theoretical issues relevant to the analysis of public policy, including both the stages of policy process and the main theories put forward to explain cross-national and temporal differences in public policy. The second part of the module uses these theoretical tools to examine in detail specific policies, including welfare and social policy, pension policy, family policy, labour market policy, immigration policy, and education policy. For each policy area, we will examine the roles of various actors, interests and institutions in the policy process, as well as the influence of broader structures and ideas in policy making."},{"title":"Colonialism and After","description":"This module is an introduction to a range of key historical problems and conceptual questions relating to the colonial and postcolonial experiences.

Students are encouraged to integrate their own disciplinary knowledge, personal experiences, and reflections as they examine the complexities of global connections throughout the module."},{"title":"Local/Global Shakespearience","description":"Have you ever been Shakespearienced? The likely answer is yes. If you’ve ever watched The Lion King or Black Panther, or listened to Taylor Swift or Radiohead, then you’ve experienced Shakespeare. The playwright’s characters, language and plot are woven into the fabric of modern popular culture and, since he set quill to parchment in sixteenth-century England, his stories have travelled across the world, impacting on the lives of countless communities and individuals. This impact is felt on both global and local levels and, on this module, you will have the opportunity to engage with key artists who adapt Shakespeare within such local and global contexts, including climate activists, film-makers, graphic novelists, podcasters and rappers. You will interrogate how Shakespeare, as a global playwright, can be indigenised and used as a platform for community identity and as a tool to explore contemporary issues of politics, race, class, gender and culture. You will also be invited to explore notions of ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture and the impact of technological innovation on the development of interdisciplinary performance forms. The dissemination of performance across cultures and technologies will be a key consideration of the module and, as a result, you will work in real time on a group practical project, create your own podcast episode and share the development of creative materials."},{"title":"Inequalities and Sustainable Development","description":"This module allows students to focus in-depth on the concept of inequalities. It analyses current debates around inequalities and socio-economic environmental sustainability in order to gain an understanding of the complexities of the problems and recognise the challenges faced by policy makers aiming to resolve those problems."},{"title":"Quest 1 – Departures and Heroic Journeys","description":"The idea of the “quest” was an animating principle throughout the premodern world. Through the quest an individual could fight evil, heal a broken social order, discover previously-unknown worlds, forge new alliances, and find their true selves along the way. Yet, how do we conceive of the quest in an age that Max Weber characterised as dominated by rationalisation, intellectualisation, and above all, a profound sense of “disenchantment” (Entzauberung)? What currency does the idea of the quest have in the modern, bureaucratic, secular world? This module complements our other core and optional modules offered in Liberal Arts and encourages you to draw upon and extend prior knowledge. The purpose of the module is for you to explore the problems involved in how quests from various disciplines frame the concept of departure and facing the unknown. Through an exploration of these issues, you’ll learn to think critically about problematising the straightforward narratives you receive through the idea of the quest in popular and contemporary culture. As the module focuses on the problem of engaging with the unknown, it’s hoped that you’ll also develop your own strategies for grappling with unfamiliar ideas and perspectives outside your comfort zone"},{"title":"Public Engagement","description":"Public engagement is about connecting the work of universities with wider society. It takes many forms – from public facing events, blogs, or social media accounts, to collaborative research and empowering citizen researchers to lead projects. Through it both we and our audiences gain valuable insights through interaction and dialogue. This module will introduce you to the concept and context of engagement. You’ll be given the tools to effectively plan and evaluate public engagement, coming away with a range of practical and highly transferable engagement skills that will support you whether you go on to a career in academia, or outside it."},{"title":"Achieving Sustainability: Potentials and Barriers","description":"Sustainability is the most significant societal challenge of our age and it is therefore imperative that all subjects should be engaging with this critical topic that will be so central to their future life and career. The module aims to present the issue of sustainability from a variety of cross-disciplinary perspectives, including academics with expertise in the natural, applied and social sciences and humanities but also people with direct engagement with sustainability issues in estates, in careers and from outside the university. In doing so, it will provide a variety of sources of knowledge that will allow students to connect to their own experience, but also to provide a multifaceted understanding of the topic."},{"title":"Challenges of Climate Change","description":"The changes to global climate being brought about by human activity present one of the greatest challenges to confront humanity, and are likely to have a profound effect over the working lives of today’s students. Understanding them requires a comprehensive approach spanning multiple disciplines. The aim of this module is to equip students to begin to do this, by providing a grounding in the central scientific, economic and political issues surrounding climate change. To provide undergraduates from a wide range of backgrounds with an up to date view of the central challenges that climate change poses. This will be delivered from experts across different disciplines, each describing challenges in their field at a level suitable for all. Following the course we aim to equip students to address these challenges."},{"title":"The Energy Trilemma","description":"Global energy markets are in a period of dramatic transition. The emergence of shale gas, mostly notably in the US, has been disruptive to the industry, leading to falling oil prices. This has challenged the long-time dominant position of international oil companies (e.g. BP, Shell, ExxonMobil) in the petroleum sector. Natural gas has emerged as a potentially important ‘bridging fuel’ to a low carbon future, with several leading national economiesincluding China, making the switch from carbon-intensive oil and coal to this ‘lower-carbon’ alternative. Away from oil and gas, renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost competitive and are gaining societal and governmental support. The energy transition alters the global dynamics of energy security, with some countries finding their energy independence challenged, whilst others enjoy the economic growth that is inherently linked to energy abundance. A similar distinction can be made between populations with regards to energy equity: the accessibility and affordability of energy, and as with energy security this too is in a state of flux due to changing market conditions. These three dimensions: sustainability, energy security and energy equity constitute an ‘energy trilemma’; the focus of this module. The module addresses the challenges posed by the trilemma to national, regional and local economies, and in developing, emerging and developed economic contexts. In addition to the trilemma’s aforementioned dimensions, the module will also consider concerns of energy efficiency, ‘green growth’, sustainable energy governance and cooperation, and technology and infrastructure. In this regard, the module will broaden the student’s knowledge and understanding of the key issues around the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 7."},{"title":"Health and Sustainable Development","description":"This module offers an in-depth examination of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (good health and well-being) and the broader field of global health. This module will involve a blend of conceptual foundations, case study analysis, and work with real-life qualitative and quantitative data. Teaching and case studies will be interdisciplinary, drawing on medical as well as social science research. It focuses focus on concepts and dimensions of global health and equip students with a big-picture understanding of health governance and health systems. A broad range of global health priorities within and beyond the Sustainable Development Goals will further enable students to grasp and discuss key issues that will dominate global health in the coming decades (e.g. universal healthcare, antimicrobial resistance), their relationship to international development and other sustainable development goals, and their global and local dimensions."},{"title":"Security, Sovereignty and Sustainability in the Global Food System","description":"The module draws on Warwick’s world leading research, especially those involved in the university’s Global Research Priority on Food, to deliver subject and analytical knowledge, as well as research and communication skills, to equip students with a multi-disciplinary toolkit for positive participation in the creation of more sustainable food systems. The module aims to examine the relationship between Food and Sustainability using theories and methods from the sciences, social sciences and humanities. By the end of the module, students should be able to: apply a “Food Systems” approach to the identification, research and analysis of broadly conceived sustainability issues, emerging in food production, processing and consumption, evaluate the contrasting technical and governance responses proposed for issues generate by global food needs, employ visual mapping of food systems for analytical purposes in creating a mixed media campaign, apply a critical understanding of key concepts, particularly food security, sovereignty and sustainability in analysis of food systems. Where relevant, reflect on and evaluate personal and collective food consumption choices in relation to sustainable development concerns"},{"title":"Understanding Wellbeing: Theory and Practice","description":"We are observing a crisis, which is growing each year, in student mental health and wellbeing in the UK universities, including the University of Warwick. The main aim of this module is to inspire you to look at a global, timely and relevant topic, such as wellbeing, in its complexity, discovering the potential of an interdisciplinary approach to the matter. The module will analyse the concept of wellbeing from the perspective of several disciplines (Biomedical disciplines, Sociology, Economics and Arts & Humanities) and will help you understand the complexity of this crucial topic and the relevance of a holistic approach in order to solve the issues related to it."},{"title":"Sustainable Cities","description":"In 1913 10% of the world’s population lived in cities (UN-HABITAT, 2011), in 2018 this had increased to an estimated 55% (UN 2018). Urban areas are expected to absorb virtually all future population growth (UN 2018) and by 2030 are projected to accommodate 60% of the global population: one-third of which will live in cities with at least half a million inhabitants (UN 2018). Despite covering only 2% of the world’s landmass, cities produce 70% of total carbon emissions, over half of the world’s GDP, are locations of often stark inequality and are uniquely vulnerable to a changing climate, as a result of their concentrated population and infrastructure. Cities are spaces of social and technological innovation, but also some of the most pressing human welfare concerns. Thus understanding the urban context is critical in promoting more sustainable trajectories of human development."},{"title":"The Slow Movement: Interdisciplinary Adventures in Time and Pace","description":"Our perception of time and pace has changed dramatically since the Industrial Revolution. Fast has become synonymous with modernity, efficiency, productivity and even exhilaration. In our constantly-connected, open-all-hours culture, we rarely have the time to reflect on the consequences. The global pandemic, however, has brought our relationship with time and pace into sharper focus. This module provides opportunity to reflect on the mental, physical, societal and environmental impact of the so-called cult of speed. It examines how the slow movement, which started in Italy in the mid-1980s, has sought to resist the acceleration of modern society. Using a variety of interactive pedagogical approaches, students will engage with a range of expert perspectives, case studies and guided activities to examine how the principles of Slow have been applied to areas such as food, travel, town-planning, education, film studies, scientific research, marketing and psychology. Students will be encouraged to reflect both on their own relationship with temporality and how the principles of the slow movement can be applied to their own academic discipline. A critical approach will be encouraged: is slow really a new movement? Is it an anti-modern rejection of capitalism or simply an alternative mode of consumption? Is slowness a luxury available only to a privileged few?"}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":144,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":104,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":105,"upperBound":150}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.47,"upperBound":3.92},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8.5,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":150}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":48,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.18,"upperBound":3.95},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":102,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":5.5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.59,"upperBound":3.95},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":102,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/43-university-of-york/","name":"University of York","available":true,"location":"United Kingdom","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 16, 2024","end":"January 31, 2025"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":87,"det":120,"regular":true},"courses":[{"title":"Intercultural Competence, Employability and Academic Skills Module","description":"The aim of this module is to provide students with the opportunity to broaden their cultural horizons and raise their international awareness and sensitivity to UK culture; enhance academic skills from innovative note-taking techniques to refined presentation skills and academic writing; and develop an understanding to recognise key employability skills (based on York Strengths Employability Skills Programme – https://www.york.ac.uk/students/work-volunteering-careers/skills/york-strengths/) and presenting them to future employers.

The module covers topics concerned with: – the need to identify and explain persistent social inequalities between male and female, between people of different colours; this includes identifying how social forces under the guise of biological forces work toperpetuate such inequalities – the effects of interlocking oppressions (e.g. Crenshaw (1993) The intersectionality of race, gender, class) – how gender and race are implicated in a broad range of social phenomena beyond the sexual and racial difference – accounts of situated lived experience of women as effective tools in the fight against injustice Further information: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/race-gender-and-feminism-BASC0042"},{"title":"Approaches to Global Politics","description":"This module starts off with a tailored overview of mainstream and critical international relations theory, before applying these to real-world events. At the core of the module is a question of how globalisation has affected the role of states in global politics, particularly against the backdrop of populist nationalism and ever-growing global challenges. The first weeks introduce main theoretical streams by discussing whether international relations are defined by anarchy or hierarchy. Once equipped with basic conceptual tools, students will focus on globalisation as a driver of global (and national) politics, as well as critically evaluating the emancipatory potential of globalisation and the liberal international order. The second half of the course then focuses on five big topics in contemporary international politics: security, development, climate change, health governance and the future shape of global politics.

During the course, we will witness London burn to the ground, be comprehensively rebuilt, and then expand from a small European capital into the largest city in the world. Along the way, we will encounter a wide variety of buildings including cathedrals, palaces, churches, synagogues, breweries, shops, and hospitals. Students will acquire skills in looking at, reading, and understanding buildings and become adept at using them as historical evidence. Students will also learn how to relate architecture to its social, political, and intellectual context, and develop insights into the ways that buildings may carry and convey meaning, whether to an expert or to a more general audience. No prior knowledge of architecture or architectural history is required to undertake the course."},{"title":"Globalisation: Capitalists, Colonisers, and Crises in the Long Twentieth Century","description":"When did the world become ‘globalised’? Who were the main architects of ‘globalisation’? How did the movement of ideas, people, money, and goods across borders reshape politics, society, and culture in diverse contexts? How did societies and groups around the world respond to and in turn reimagine this historical process? This module looks at key moments in the history of globalisation over the `long¿ twentieth century. Approaching globalisation as a contested and malleable project, we will move from the `first¿ high age of globalisation and empire in the late nineteenth century, through the reconfiguration of the world system in the wake of the Great Depression and the World Wars, to the era of decolonisation and neoliberal globalisation in the latter part of the century. We will reflect together on how capitalism, internationalism, empire, immigration, race, the environment, and human rights came to shape the contemporary world."},{"title":"Unravelling Britain: British History since 1801","description":"Over the last two centuries, Britain has changed beyond recognition. From the industrial revolution to the sexual revolution, new forces have transformed the lives of ordinary men and women. The rise and fall of the British Empire, a series of global wars and migration to and from Britain challenged what it meant to be British, while political institutions became increasingly democratic. In the sciences, the theory of evolution, the invention of television and the coming of the atom bomb offered exciting and sometimes terrifying possibilities, with far-reaching effects on British society. New forms of leisure emerged, while attitudes towards homosexuality, race, religion and the rights of women have been redrawn. This module provides a rich introduction to modern British history, from 1801 to the present day. If you have not previously studied the period, it will give you the foundation for specialist modules in subsequent years. If you have some prior knowledge, it will challenge you with new interpretations from the cutting edge of historical research. The module introduces you to new critical approaches to the subject and draws extensively on primary sources such as film, pop music and visual imagery. It has a strong global dimension, showing how crises in India, Asia and Africa shaped the ‘British World’. By the end of the module, you will have developed new skills in source analysis while challenging your preconceptions about modern Britain. Above all, we hope to enthuse you with the richness and diversity of British history, and the possibilities it offers for further study."},{"title":"Culture and Language (a)","description":"This course will introduce students to a wide range of texts, both historical and contemporary, and the skills they need to analyse them.

Successful innovation is a very complex process and has to be very carefully managed. There is no ‘right way’ to manage innovation. Therefore it is important to analyse the innovation process from a range of different perspectives, for example, the role of the state in innovation and the core competencies of the firm."},{"title":"Introduction to International Relations","description":"This module provides an introduction to the study of international relations. Specifically, we focus on four main themes that will allow you to grasp the complexities of the contemporary global order: capitalism, (post)colonialism, security, and development. You will also become acquainted with the analytical tools that are needed to think critically about international relations through these themes: a historical sensibility (i.e. how situations have elements of both continuity and change), an understanding of political-economy (i.e. why the economy is political), an understanding of the security-development nexus (i.e. how the quest for security – freedom from fear -and development – freedom from want -are contentiously linked), and the importance of resistance and “situated knowledges” (i.e. your understanding of international relations might be different depending on where and how you are situated in the world). Empirically, we will explore the Cold War and the post-Cold War global orders – their similarities and differences."},{"title":"Cultural Geographies","description":"A geographical perspective on culture emphasises the processes and politics that produce spaces, places and landscapes, and how these in turn shape different cultures. The module is interdisciplinary in scope and explores a range of cultural landscapes, grounded in walking-based explorations of East London.

The overarching aim is that students will be prompted to reconsider and extend their own perspectives on cultural matters as they develop knowledge, intellectual tools and practical skills for making sense of the world around them."},{"title":"Victorian Fictions I","description":"This module will introduce students to a range of Victorian fiction. It addresses the content, form, and significance of the Victorian novel (famously nicknamed a ‘loose baggy monster’) and how it develops amid the cultural, historical, and intellectual contexts of nineteenth-century Britain. It also examines the alternative form of the short story and considers what specific kinds of narrative and narrative effects this form enables. Authors to be studied may include Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Lewis Carroll, Wilkie Collins, Dinah Mulock Craik, Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, Thomas Hardy, Henry James, Vernon Lee, Margaret Oliphant, Bram Stoker, and William Thackeray."},{"title":"London: Walking the City","description":"This module invites students to ways of reading London. Students will read London literary texts from the early modern period to the present day and encounter the city through walking, travelling along its transport connections, listening to guides, looking around them and engaging self-reflexively with the meanings and imperatives found in the city. The module will include walking lectures, seminars and workshops and will develop skills of close reading, observation, critical thinking and effective communication."},{"title":"Modernism I","description":"This module introduces you to the style, history, politics and controversies of modernism. We will read central modernist texts such as Joyce’s ‘Ulysses’, Eliot’s ‘The Waste Land’, and Woolf’s ‘To the Lighthouse’, alongside a selection of modernist and modern writers, critics, journalists and intellectuals. Over eleven weeks, we will see how modernism developed in the 1910s and 20s, and examine a range of contexts for its stylistic experiments in narrative and point of view, in urban life, war, sexual emancipation, and psychology."},{"title":"Cognitive Psychology","description":"This module introduces theory and research in cognitive psychology, the study of the human mind and mental processes. Key theories and research in cognitive psychology will be discussed, including visual and multi-modal perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, and decision-making.

This module raises questions about the historical nature of borders and belonging. In order to reflect on contingency and transformation, we take an expansive spatial and temporal approach, stretching from the medieval to the modern world and using case studies from both the Western and non-Western worlds. By doing so, we will question dichotomies between mobility and stability, as well as assumptions of borders and settledness. Themes and topics may include: exile, empire, race, state-making, minorities, borders and policing. Illustrative case studies may include Anglo-Dutch crossings of the Channel in the 18th century; Population transfers under the League of Nations aegis in the early 20th century; Passports for the Indian diaspora from the 1950s-70s."},{"title":"Critical Geography: Environment and Society","description":"This module provides a critical geographical framework for understanding the key issues of climate change, waste, population change and hazards and addressing questions of social and environmental justice. We begin by engaging with recent efforts to decolonise geography in light of the imperial origins of British geography and the historical and continued impact of European colonialism. This is the theme of our fieldtrip to the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). This provides a foundation for our focus on environmental racism and the unequal impacts of environmental change. Bringing together critical perspectives from human and physical geography, the module will equip you with knowledge and understanding of the causes, challenges and implications of these entangled social and environmental issues."},{"title":"Global Worlds","description":"This module will introduce students to a range of core issues affecting the world around them from economic, cultural and social perspectives with a particular focus on the importance of global-local relations revolving around inequality and justice.

How is human language different from non-human animal communication systems? What are the similarities and differences between signed and spoken languages? Can the language you speak influence how you see colours? This unit addresses these questions and more, exploring the cognitive underpinnings of human language. Along the way we’ll examine evidence from babies, chimpanzees and other animals, the birth of new languages, perceptual illusions, strokes and other brain injuries, intoxicated speech, swearing, and modern brain imaging techniques. We’ll also take a look at the social and historical contexts in which our ideas about language and cognition have evolved, examining the role of factors such as colonialism and ablelism in shaping the field.”"},{"title":"Climate Change and Society","description":"“Why does climate change policy, despite attracting a worldwide interest, remain a disappointment? Is it because the world is not working hard enough to implement existing climate policies, or because the issue is so difficult that no amount of good work will be sufficient to control the rising greenhouse emissions? You will explore why climate change became the environmental and socio-economic problem of the century; why it took so long after the discovery of the greenhouse effect for politicians to become aware of its cataclysmic potential; and who brought the issue to the policy arena. The unit sets recent – and future – developments in the context of the historic background in which ‘climate change’ affected the material life of both traditional and high-output societies. It explores the role of science, the function of politics, and the promise of industry to bring the problem under control and to the fore of public policy. The unit further explores how climate change features in the public sphere and whether the media works to be transparent in conveying scientific knowledge. The unit suits students of all academic backgrounds, including humanities students, who are keen to use creative approaches to think about today’s environmental issues.”"},{"title":"From Cholera to COVID-19: A global history of epidemics","description":"“With the recent experiences of the Coronavirus outbreak, students will learn how historically infectious diseases have spread across the world, how people, health systems and governments have reacted to these and what lessons can be learnt from global pandemics in the past This unit covers the global history of epidemics, starting from the global pandemic of Cholera in the nineteenth century across Asia, Africa, Europe and America to the contemporary experiences of COVID-19 and Ebola. It brings together insights from history, medicine, public health, bacteriology, and quarantine. You will investigate why, in the contemporary world, some countries and communities are relatively free from epidemics while others continue to suffer from them. You will identify the larger structural factors, such as the economy, trade, labour movements, gender and class that lead to epidemics and see that disease is often caused by global inequality and poverty.”"},{"title":"From Sherlock Holmes to CSI: A History of Forensic Science and Medicine","description":"In this unit you will investigate the growing literature on the legal application of medical and scientific expertise.

Topics include; “Determining Sanity”, “Poison and the Victorians” and “DNA Fingerprints, Proof and Persuasion”."},{"title":"In Frankenstein's Footsteps: Science Fiction in Literature and Film","description":"“Do scientists play God? Is it possible to understand an alien? Will machines rise up and enslave us? Does the rapid pace of scientific and technological change point towards a future paradise – or a hell on Earth? Or just to a different world that seems equally “normal”? These are questions which authors and film-makers have long explored through fiction, for a wide variety of reasons: to make money by providing popular entertainment; to explore philosophical questions about the nature of humanity, technology or civilisation; to promote possible future projects in real life, or to warn of emerging dangers; to comment on the politics, social issues and cultural assumptions of their own times. This course uses science fiction literature and film from the nineteenth century to the present day to explore the changing place of science in the cultural imagination. We ask how science fiction has revealed – and sometimes changed – public dreams and anxieties around technology, the power of science, the future of our earth, and what it means to be human.”"},{"title":"Fundamentals of Management","description":"“1) Define management and explain how management differs according to level and whether a manager is a line manager or an enabling role. 2) Briefly describe and contrast four models of management; rational goal, scientific, human relations, open systems. 3) Describe and attain some elementary level of skills in the main management processes: planning, organizing, staffing, deciding, controlling and budgeting. 4) Outline the notion of a management function and be able to name, briefly describe and appreciate the role of the four main management functions: marketing, production (including quality and other technical services), finance and personnel. 5) Discuss and identify the implications of wider management issues such as managing technology, managing diversity, globalization and ethics.”"},{"title":"Crime & Society","description":"“This course is about the problem of crime.

Thought about what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur, or questioned if you could become one yourself? Becoming an enterprising individual and developing a new business venture can be both physically and emotionally demanding. Successful entrepreneurs have to become focused on creating and establishing a successful business, which is a risky and time consuming process that entrepreneurs try to navigate as best they can, whilst juggling a wide range of demands and commitments. This unit explores who and what entrepreneurs are and how they use motivation and self-development/reflection to improve on their decision-making skills to enhance both their personal and venture’s performance. The unit addresses key questions such as: What makes a successful entrepreneur? Can any person be entrepreneurial? What skill sets do I need to become an entrepreneur?

Digital technology has made charts, maps, and data visualisation easier to create and share than ever. Whether we are dealing with climate change graphs, invasion maps, or visualisations of artificial intelligence, well-designed charts and maps can be empowering, but they can also be ambiguous or misleading. Indeed, we are often ill-equipped to approach visual information critically. In this course, you will learn to engage with information visually. You will learn to recognise and critique oversimplifying, biased, or misleading forms of visual representation, and to create your own visualisations to explore and communicate data that matters to you. Using examples from a wide range of academic disciplines – from economics, to literature, meteorology, history, urban design, or computer science – you will discover key principles of visual thinking and communication and learn how to create your own charts and maps. Historically, data visualisation has often been used to discriminate, control, and police. In this course, you will also explore interventions by critical data scientists, scholars, and activists who visualise data to expose injustice, challenge unfair classification systems, and speak truth to power. The course allows you to formulate your own questions and answer them using a suite of digital tools that allow you to develop and present your argument through visualisation and narrative. Note that this course does not involve any coding and does not require any previous technical knowledge.”"},{"title":"Are We Alone? The Search for Extraterrestrial Life","description":"“””Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.”” – Arthur C. Clarke The question of whether we are alone in the universe is one of the most fundamental that humankind can ask. If we are truly alone, does this mean that we are in some way special? If there are other civilisations out there, do they look and think like us? Would we be able to recognise their signatures from space and communicate with them? This unit introduces the astrophysical, biological and social factors that influence the probability of the emergence of long-lived, intelligent, technical civilisations. It explores the biological and technological signatures that might reveal advanced civilisations and the new instruments currently under development that will enable future searches. If we are not alone, we consider dissemination strategies, legal issues associated with first ‘contact’, the construction of interstellar messages, and the implications for society and culture in terms of global politics, the world economy, theology, art, literature and science. The unit provides a comprehensive overview of the most recent developments on the search for life and intelligent civilisations, elsewhere in the Universe. It also discusses issues such as the sustainability of humankind and our own possible futures. Are the challenges we face the same that all long-lived technical civilisations must also face and overcome? Note that this an online unit. Online units can help students to resolve timetable clashes between synchronous units.”"},{"title":"Introduction to Ethics","description":"This course unit will examine some hard moral questions: Is it ever right to abort a foetus?

Students engage with theory through case studies that integrate the other key aspects of IR. This provides a practical, discussion-based tutorial environment in which the complexities of global politics can be studied. International History This aspect of the course provides students with an historical context within which to locate current issues in global politics. Specifically focusing on international history since 1945, students will be required to think about how changing historical circumstances have both altered the agenda of the academic study of IR and affect current interpretations of events. Security Studies Security issues remain central to the study of global politics, especially in the context of the post-9/11 world. This aspect of the course introduces students to the study of security issues in IR. Engaging with this aspect, students are asked to consider how, and in what ways, security issues have changed since the end of the cold war. International Political Economy It is increasingly recognised that the study of international politics is about more than just the study of war and peace. International Political Economy (IPE) considers the linkages between politics and economics (or the state and the market) at the global level. As the course examines the economic aspects of global politics, students are introduced to the study of IPE focussing on the way in which an IPE perspective helps us to make sense of the debates surrounding ‘globalisation’.”"},{"title":"Introduction to Philosophy of Mind","description":"“This course explores philosophical issues about the nature of mind and mentality. Are mental states physical states of the brain, or are they states of an immaterial mind or soul, or are they something else altogether? We will examine the chief metaphysical theories of the nature of mind: dualism, behaviourism, the identity theory, functionalism, and materialism or physicalism generally. Many, perhaps all, mental states are about or represent things in the world, such as our beliefs about Cleopatra. How do they do this? Is there some kind of mechanism that connects our beliefs about Cleopatra to that ancient Egyptian queen? More generally, can we explain mental representation physically or scientifically? Many mental states are also conscious. But what is consciousness? Is consciousness physical? Can it be explained scientifically? What about thinking? Many of our thought processes are rational. Can we explain the rationality of thought? We will explore the computational theory of mind, which purports to explain the rationality of thought physically by assuming the mind is a kind of computer, a computer that could in principle be realised synthetically as an artificial intelligence. We will also try to understand exactly what it means to say that the mind is physical or that mental states depend on physical states, such as brain states, and will try to determine whether the existence of physical-to-mental and mental-to-physical causation favours a physicalist view of mind.”"},{"title":"Foundations of Criminal Justice","description":"“This course introduces students to the institutions that form the criminal justice system (CJS) and explores key features and debates relating to each of them in historical, social and policy context.

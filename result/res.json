As we rely more and more on machines and other new technologies, they are changing how we interact with the world and one another. In this course we will consider the impact of artificial intelligence on our current lives, and on our future. It has been said that “Philosophy will be the key that unlocks artificial intelligence”—presumably for the better. On the other hand, the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom has warned that advances in superintelligence may soon make humans obsolete. Who should we believe? This course will address these and other issues by first considering some traditional questions in philosophy of mind—e.g., Can a robot think? What is the Turing Test? Can machines ever be conscious?— before turning to a consideration of some of the ethical and social implications of this new technology."},{"title":"Race and the struggle for Freedom in America","description":"Race and the struggle for Freedom in America This course explores African-American history from the end of slavery to today.

Simple techniques for data analysis are used to illustrate both effective and fallacious uses of data science tools. Although this course is designed to be at the level of mathematical sciences courses in the Core, with little background required, we expect the students to develop computational skills that will allow them to analyze data. Computation will be done using Python and Jupyter Notebook."},{"title":"Women and Work in Modern East","description":"Worldwide, women do about 75 percent of the world’s unpaid care and domestic work. They spend up to three hours more per day cooking and cleaning than men do, and anywhere from two to ten hours more per day looking after children and the elderly. Women’s underpaid work at home and in industry subsidized the early stages of industrialization in nineteenth-century Britain, early twentieth-century Japan, and contemporary China, and women’s unpaid contributions to their households enable employers worldwide to keep wages low. We know, at least in outline, how women came to carry double burdens in Europe and North America, but little research has been done so far about this process in East Asia. In this course, we will discuss when and how China, Japan, and Korea developed a division of labor in which most wage work was gendered male and reproductive work was marked female. This course will discuss about current divisions of labor between men and women rooted in local cultures, or are they the result of industrial capitalist development. Moreover, about how do divisions of labor differ between the three East Asian countries, and how did developments in one East Asian country affect others."},{"title":"Nuclear Policy","description":"While issues arising from technologies that have both military and civilian applications are not new, the nearly incomprehensible destruction from exploding nuclear weapons focuses the mind as few other dual-use technologies can. This course will examine the development of national policies and the international regimes on the uses of nuclear energy. We will review military doctrine and the plans for nuclear war-fighting as well as the effects on societies of developing and using nuclear weapons. We will review the history of international proliferation of nuclear technology and fissile material and examine efforts to curtail the spread of weapons. In the second part of the course, we will focus on the development of civilian nuclear power and on current policy to prevent accidents and dispose of nuclear waste materials. Political leaders often face policy dilemmas because nuclear technology and materials offer great benefit, as well as presenting great danger. We will explore these dilemmas throughout the course."},{"title":"American Grand Strategy","description":"This course examines the evolution of American grand strategy since 1900, when the United States first emerged on the world stage as a great power. The focus will be on assessing how its leaders have thought over time about: 1) which areas of the world are worth fighting and dying for, 2) when it is necessary to fight in those strategically important areas, and 3) what kinds of military forces are needed for deterrence and warfighting in those regions."},{"title":"Postcolonial and Decolonial History","description":"This course introduces students to some key texts in post and decolonial theory. Our goals in this class are three-fold. First, to familiarize students with foundational thinkers who have inspired both decolonial and postcolonial work. We draw attention to the different ways in which their ideas have been deployed in subsequent post and decolonial scholarship. Second, we ask questions oriented towards comparison of postcolonial and decolonial approaches: What, if any, are the points of overlap between decolonial and postcolonial thought? How do both bodies of work critique and contest the legacies of empire? Third, we investigate the present and possible futures of decolonial and postcolonial thought."},{"title":"Death & Dying","description":"Death is a universal human experience relevant to all areas of social work practice. Through readings, films, discussions and exercises, students will develop an understanding of the dying experience, as well as the attitudes toward and the approach to death and dying in America. The medical system’s influence on end of life care and the rise of hospice and palliative care will be a focus of this course. The notion of a “good death” and the impact of ethnic, cultural, religious and spiritual influences will be explored, as well as advance care planning and the overarching ethical and moral dilemmas that can arise. While the topics of grief and bereavement are not explicitly covered, time will be devoted to exploring loss across the life course, as well as the impact of violent and sudden deaths on victims and their families. In addition, students will have the opportunity to develop a self-awareness of their own values and beliefs toward dying and death, and explore strategies for self-care."},{"title":"Cultural Psychology","description":"There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of “normal” psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of “culture” and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning."},{"title":"Building the New Venture","description":"This course is intended for students who are interested in starting new entrepreneurial businesses. It is tactical, hands-on, and covers the nuts and bolts of starting a company with a lesser emphasis on investing in entrepreneurial ventures. Students will learn how to raise seed funding, compensate for limited human and financial resources, establish brand values and positioning, secure a strong niche position, determine appropriate sourcing and sales channels, and develop execution plans in sales, marketing, product development and operations. The emphasis is managerial and entrepreneurial, essentially a working model for starting an enterprise. This class is executed through a combination of lectures, group assignments based on student’s new venture ideas, case discussions, VC and entrepreneur guest lectures and panels, and ultimately ties together in a pitch at the end of the quarter to a panel of VC observers."},{"title":"Topics in Behavioral Economics","description":"Behavioral economics applies psychological insights to economic markets and decision making. In this class, we will discuss the recent theoretical and empirical advances that have been made in this increasingly important field of economics. Being thoughtful about the role of psychology can lead to a greater understanding of how the economy works."},{"title":"Managing in Organizations","description":"Successfully managing other people – be they competitors or co-workers – requires an understanding of their thoughts, feelings, attitudes, motivations, and determinants of behavior. Developing an accurate understanding of these factors, however, can be difficult to achieve because intuitions are often misguided and unstructured experience can be a poor teacher. This course is intended to address this development by providing the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical for successfully managing others, and also for successfully managing ourselves."},{"title":"International Corporate Finance","description":""},{"title":"Experimental Economics","description":"This course provides the necessary tools to be an avid consumer of the experimental literature and instructs students on how to become a producer of that literature. Topics include a summary of recent experimental findings and details on how to gather and analyze data using experimental methods."},{"title":"Insurgency, Terrorism, and Civil War","description":"This course introduces students to modern, social scientific approaches to the study of political violence. We will focus on several key questions: What are the causes of political violence? How is violence used? Who participates in political violence? What do we know about how to counter the use of violence? How are rebel groups organized? And what are the consequences of violence for society? As we address these questions, we will aim to meet three interrelated goals. First, students will come away from the course with a better sense of the social mechanisms underlying these critical phenomena and a more nuanced understanding of the policy challenges that political violence poses. Second, students will develop an appreciation for how difficult these questions are to answer. Finally, the course is designed to help students think critically about what we learn from the evidence, so that they can engage the relevant policy debates in a serious-minded and informed way."},{"title":"Psychoactive drugs, the Brain and Behavior","description":"The goal of this course is for the students to understand how psychoactive drugs affect the brain and behavior. Understanding how these drugs work will provide students a window in the relationship between the brain and behavior. Understanding how drugs affect the brain and behavior will also enhance the students understanding of the relationship between psychoactive drugs/medications and society."},{"title":"Introduction to Film Analysis","description":"This course introduces basic concepts of film analysis, which students will discuss through examples from different national cinemas, genres, and directorial oeuvres. We will consider film as an art form, medium, and industry, and cover all the major film types: silent, classical, and contemporary narrative cinema, art cinema, animation, documentary, and experimental film. We will study the cinematic techniques: mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound, and learn how filmmakers design their works. Films discussed will include works Orson Welles, Sergei Eisenstein, Shirin Neshat, Lucrecia Martel, and Wong Kar Wai."},{"title":"Environmental Justice in Principle and Practice","description":"Students will learn about different types of environmental injustice and how they intersect with other social problems, including segregation, housing, the devaluing of the lives of people of color, and the geographic distribution of environmental ills. Speakers from communities how have experienced environmental injustices in Chicago will be invited to share their perspectives with students in order to supplement readings from a diverse set of sources and outlooks."},{"title":"Justice and the Economy","description":"This course will explore how contemporary political philosophy conceptualizes the economy, frames the question of economic justice and injustice, and provides a normative case for and against ways of organizing economic institutions. By focusing on a set of specific issues including the justification of property rights, the moral and institutional demands of economic justice, freedom and domination within the labor market, the normative status of corporations, capitalism as a form of structural injustice, and the possibility (or lack thereof) of just financial markets, the seminar will offer a chance to read both classical authors in contemporary political philosophy, including John Rawls, Iris Young, Elizabeth Anderson, and Robert Nozick, as well as more recent and less known literature on the subject. A focus on economic justice will also provide an opportunity to discuss how contemporary political philosophy is either indebted or oblivious to a series of theoretical frameworks traditionally used to approach questions of economic justice, including classical liberalism, republicanism, utilitarianism, Marxism, critical theory, and utopian thought."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2023":{"RA":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.12,"upperBound":3.97},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":5,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.81,"upperBound":3.97},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/21-university-of-texas-at-austin/","name":"University of Texas at Austin","location":"United States of America","academicPeriod":{"start":"August 21, 2023","end":"December 11, 2023"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":78},"courses":[{"title":"American Studies","description":"American Studies focuses on the cultural, social, and intellectual life of the United States of America.

Broadly speaking, marketing strategy making is comprised of segmentation, targeting and positioning. Segmentation is the process by which we segregate a relatively heterogeneous mass market into relatively homogeneous market segments. Targeting is the process by which we analyze opportunities and identify those customers where our business has the greatest prospects for success. Positioning is the process of assembling the ‘total offering’ (product, service, distribution and price) and communicating the benefits of this ‘total offering’ to the members of our target market.

We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways– particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of “World Music” by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process."},{"title":"Global Media","description":"This course explores a broad media landscape through new critical and conceptual approaches. It is designated as a Benjamin Franklin Seminar. This course maps the footprints of television at a global scale. Adopting comparative approaches, we will be studying TV’s formation of national and global discourses, and thereby recognizing not only television’s impact on processes of globalization, but also the ability of television to matter globally. Working through concepts of “broadcasting,” “flow,” “circulation,” and “circumvention,” the course examines the movement of (and blocks encountered by) television programs and signals across national borders and cultures. The course particularly focuses on how global television cultures have been transformed due to shifts from broadcasting technologies to (Internet) streaming services? Navigating from United States and Cuba to India and Egypt, the readings in the course illuminate how particular televisual genres, institutions, and reception practices emerged in various countries during specific historical periods."},{"title":"Intro to Asian American Studies","description":"According to the U.S. Census, there are approximately 21 million Asian residents in the U.S. that comprise almost 6 percent of the total population. This relatively small number disguises the critical experiences Asian American communities face in both the local and transnational context. Yet, Asian Americans constitute one of the most heterogeneous racial groups within the U.S. Over the course of this semester we will read about and actively discuss the history of Asian immigration to the U.S., the social construction and experience of race in the U.S., and the political, economic, and cultural contributions of Asian Americans. We will also examine how Asian Americans negotiate/deploy their culture and ethnicity to achieve recognition in multicultural America and how the construction of Asian American identity intersects with class, gender, and sexuality."},{"title":"Applied Data Analysis","description":"This course will examine how and when data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize (a) the critical role of an underlying economic theory of behavior in interpreting data and guiding analysis, as well as (b) a range of advanced techniques for inferring causality from data, such as randomized controlled trials, regression discontinuity, difference-in-difference, audit study (mystery shopping) approaches and stock-market event studies. The issue of causality, and the relevance of thinking about models and methods for inferring causality, is just as central and important for “Big Data” as it is when working with traditional data sets in business and public policy. The emphasis will not be on proofs and derivations but rather on understanding the underlying concepts, the practical use, implications and limitations of techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy, to develop the skills to use data analysis to make better decisions. All analysis will be conducted using R. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers able to interpret and evaluate empirical studies as well as expert producers of convincing empirical analysis themselves."},{"title":"Intro to Micro Economics","description":"Introduction to economic analysis and its application. Theory of supply and demand, costs and revenues of the firm under perfect competition, monopoly and oligopoly, pricing of factors of production, income distribution, and theory of international trade. Econ 1 deals primarily with microeconomics."},{"title":"Econometric Machine Learning Methods and Models","description":"This course covers econometric methods, machine learning methods, and their interface, focusing on aspects of estimation, inference, and prediction in causal and non-causal environments. Topics may include Bayesian learning; recursive estimation and optimal filtering; randomized controlled trials and their approximation; latent variables; classification; topic analysis; LDA models; neural networks; random forests; regularization (shrinkage, selection, …); network estimation and description."},{"title":"Data Science for Studying Language and the Mind","description":"Data Science for studying Language and the Mind is an entry-level course designed to teach basic principles of data science to students with little or no background in statistics or computer science. Students will learn to identify patterns in data using visualizations and descriptive statistics; make predictions from data using machine learning and optimization; and quantify the certainty of their predictions using statistical models. This course aims to help students build a foundation of critical thinking and computational skills that will allow them to work with data in all fields related to the study of the mind (e.g. linguistics, psychology, philosophy, cognitive science)."},{"title":"Language, Cognition and Culture","description":"This is a course on how language relates to other cognitive systems. We will discuss the question of whether and how the language one speaks affects the way one thinks, the relation between words and concepts, the link between language acquisition and conceptual development in children, and the potential role of language in shaping uniquely human concepts. The course incorporates cross-linguistic, cross-cultural and developmental perspectives and combines readings from linguistics, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields within cognitive science."},{"title":"Ideas in Mathematics","description":"Topics from among the following: logic, sets, calculus, probability, history and philosophy of mathematics, game theory, geometry, and their relevance to contemporary science and society. Prerequisite: May also be counted toward the General Requirement in Natural Science & Mathematics."},{"title":"Knowledge for Social Impact: Analyzing Current Issues and Approaches","description":"Recent technological changes have raised awareness of the magnitude and devastating long-term effects of poverty, food insecurity, limited and unequal access to education, and other social issues. Coupled with growing awareness of these issues is the emerging sense that traditional government programs and charities may be unable to solve these problems – at least, not alone. What may be needed are new strategies – strategies borne of (a) a deep understanding of the issues; (b) interdisciplinary collaboration; and (c) access to business knowledge, frameworks, and resources. This course is designed to provide the information, strategies, examples, and analytical mindset to make students more rigorous, insightful, and effective in analyzing social ills and crafting potential solutions. Together, a cross-disciplinary group of undergraduate students, including students in Wharton, the College, and other Penn Schools, will examine the nature and extent of two pressing social problems – food insecurity and barriers to post-secondary education – and current approaches to solving these problems."},{"title":"Venture Capital and Entrepreneurial ","description":"This course focuses on venture capital management issues in the context of a high-growth potential start-up company. The course is motivated by rapid increases in both the supply of and demand for private equity over the past two decades. The topic is addressed from two distinct perspectives: issues that relate to the demand for private equity and venture capital (the entrepreneur’s perspective) on the one hand, and issues that relate to the supply of capital (the investor’s perspective) on the other. As well, we will address management issues that relate to how the VC and the entrepreneur work together once an investment has been made, compensation issues, and governance issues in the privately held venture capital backed company. Format: Case/discussion format, supplemented by lectures and guest speakers. Requirements: Classroom participation, written case assignments, late midterm. Materials: Required Coursepack and supplemental recommended reading."},{"title":"Ethics","description":"Ethics is the study of right and wrong behavior. This introductory course will introduce students to major ethical theories, the possible sources of normativity, and specific ethical problems and questions. Topics may include euthanasia, abortion, animal rights, the family, sexuality, bioethics, crime and punishment and war."},{"title":"Modern Political Thought","description":"This course will provide an overview of major figures and themes of modern political thought. We will focus on themes and questions pertinent to political theory in the modern era, particularly focusing on the relationship of the individual to community, society, and state. Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral, political, and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras, it is in the seventeenth century that it takes firm hold in defining the state, political institutions, moral thinking, and social relations. The centrality of “the individual” has created difficulties, even paradoxes, for community and social relations, and political theorists have struggled to reconicle those throughout the modern era. We will consider the political forms that emerged out of those struggles, as well as the changed and distinctly “modern” conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom, responsibilty, justice, rights and obligations, as central categories for organizing moral and political life."},{"title":"Intro to Experimental Psychology","description":"This course provides an introduction to the basic topics of psychology including our three major areas of distribution: the biological basis of behavior, the cognitive basis of behavior, and individual and group bases of behavior. Topics include, but are not limited to, neuropsychology, learning, cognition, development, disorder, personality, and social psychology."},{"title":"Introduction to Sociology","description":"Sociology provides a unique way to look at human behavior and social interaction. Sociology is the systematic study of the groups and societies in which people live. In this introductory course, we analyze how social structures and cultures are created, maintained, and changed, and how they affect the lives of individuals. We will consider what theory and research can tell us about our social world."},{"title":"Digital Democracy ","description":"Technological infrastructure shapes what forms of political life are possible within a society. Political campaigns, investigative journalism, public engagement, protest, government – all unfold on different time scales, in different forms, and with different consequences depending on what machines mediate them. This course explores the forms of American political life that have taken shape in and through modern digital computing. We will investigate especially a perceived tension at the heart of computing technologies – from artificial intelligence to social media – as they have been introduced to so many corners of American political life: Are computing technologies agents of liberation, or of control? The internet, for example, was embraced by some as an inherently democratizing and liberating force, giving users equal access to voice and information. On the other hand, many feared the internet as an unprecedented platform for corporate and government surveillance and manipulation. This course will analyze and historicize this tension, looking to unpack the complex and controversial role of computers in American political life from the Cold War to @POTUS."},{"title":"Narrative Across Cultures","description":"The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective."},{"title":"Judgement and Decisions","description":"Thinking, judgment, and personal and societal decision making, with emphasis on fallacies and biases."},{"title":"Analytics and the Digital Economy","description":"Students who take this course will engage with the world of data science using tools such as Tableau and R that are becoming increasingly popular in industry. The second half of the course extends students’ experience to industry applications of text mining and machine learning and requires students to work with more unstructured data. Each week of the course will be devoted to analysis of a data set from a particular industry (e.g. HR, sports, fashion, real estate, music, education, politics, restaurants, non-profit work), which we will use to answer business questions by applying analytic techniques. The course is very hands-on, and students will be expected to become proficient at applying data to business decisions and at effectively analyzing large data sets to inform decisions about business problems."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":309,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.03,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":107,"upperBound":114},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":105,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.47,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8.5,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":145,"upperBound":160}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":155,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.11,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":99,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":65,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.44,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":150,"upperBound":160}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/06-yale-university/","name":"Yale University","location":"United States of America","academicPeriod":{"start":"May 28, 2023","end":"August 04, 2023"},"language":{"ielts":7,"toefl":100,"det":120},"courses":[{"title":"Topics in International Economics","description":"Recent developments in international economics.

The course poses these questions from diverse angles and emphasizes watching films from many traditions, places, and periods, in order to become articulate, reflexive, and voracious cinephiles well beyond the context of this class. Students study the history of filmmaking across the globe, with a heavy focus on films made beyond the global North-West, considering how films are made and distributed, who pays for them, and how they find local as well as global audiences. Course examines film history within the larger context of colonialism and globalization, thinking about what it means to watch world cinema from the specific vantage point of a Western, American university."},{"title":"Education and Empire","description":"This course offers an introduction to the transnational history of education in relation to the development of U.S. empire both at home and abroad. By bringing together topics often approached separately — immigration, education, race, colonialism, and the history of U.S. empire — we will interrogate the ways that education has been mobilized to deploy power: controlling knowledge, categorizing and policing difference, administering unequal paths to citizenship/belonging, forcing assimilation, promoting socio-economic divides, and asserting discipline and control. Topics to be covered include American Indian education and self-determination, African American education in slavery and freedom, U.S. colonial education in the Philippines/Cuba/Puerto Rico, immigration and forced Americanization schooling, Latinx fights for educational access and autonomy, State Department experiments in educational diplomacy and child socialization, educational missions abroad, and national security and the war on terror. Throughout, we will draw links between the past and the present and ask what it might mean to “decolonize” education today."},{"title":"Film, Video, and American History","description":"This course looks at American history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the lens of film and video. Students will learn to analyze fiction and nonfiction moving pictures in the context of social and cultural history. Emphasis will be placed on using films and videos as historical sources. Topics will include: The Great Migration, The Jazz Age, the Great Depression, World War II, Civil Rights, the Vietnam War, September 11th, and contemporary activist movements. Screenings will include feature films such as Within Our Gates, Sullivan’s Travels, Casablanca, Night of the Living Dead, and Selma. This course seeks to expand students’ knowledge of the history of American film, culture, and society."},{"title":"What is Law?","description":"As an introductory class both to the main principles and topics of legal thought and practice, and to cultural criticism, the class will use works of literature, theatre, film and music to acquaint with the field of law, and vice versa. Students will learn in what ways culture has shaped the law, and, in turn, how law governs and shapes culture. Topics include being a person on Instagram and Facebook; Black Lives Matter, the US Constitution; Freedom of Speech, “Calling out” and “Cancel Culture”; Interpretation and Authority; Law, Ethics and Religion; Islam, Nazi Dictatorship and Totalitarianism, The Trump Administration; Criminal Law, Agency and Multiple Personality Disorder; Sampling and Copyright, Hip Hop/Rap in the courtroom."},{"title":"Energy, Environment, and Public Policy","description":"Seminar that covers the technology, use, and impact of energy on the environment, climate, security, and the economy.

Poverty and structural violence; struggles with infectious disease; the health of women and children; human rights and medical humanitarianism. Focus on sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Middle East. *Limited to 18 students"},{"title":"Investigative Journalism","description":"Techniques of in-depth reporting, ranging from interviews and document research to journalistic storytelling; the evolution of “muckraking” in the United States; and the ethical, philosophical, and political issues raised by such work. Improvement of the students’ practical research and narrative skills through weekly assignments and a term-long writing project. Designed equally for those with journalistic experience and for those with skills in other arenas. *Limited to 30 students"},{"title":"Trust–and Mistrust","description":"Trust involves a tension. On the one hand, we must build trust on the basis of its absence. On the other hand, trust is best built when a measure of it already exists between those who are trying to strengthen it. What is trust, such that violations of it yield a sense of betrayal rather than mere disappointment? What is the relation between epistemic and practical trust? When, if ever, is it rational to place one’s trust in someone, some group or some thing – or to mistrust them? Can philosophers be proponents of the value of trust without ceding our role as critical, skeptical, even mistrustful thinkers? The topic has timely social and political implications. Liberal democracy depends upon citizens trusting that they share a common world and set of institutions enabling them to negotiate differences fairly. The aim of enemies of democracy is to sow doubts in the public so as to undermine trust in democratic institutions. This invites a consideration of phenomena such as polarization, epistemic bubbles, echo chambers, populism, conspiracy theories, “truth decay,” and even the idea of “a post-truth culture.” In the face of these challenges, how can we hope to rebuild trust in one another and democratic institutions?"},{"title":"Medicine and the Humanities: Certainty and Unknowing","description":"Sherwin Nuland often referred to medicine as “the Uncertain Art.” In this course, we will address the role of uncertainty in medicine, and the role that narrative plays in capturing that uncertainty. We will focus our efforts on major authors and texts that define the modern medical humanities, with primary readings by Mikhail Bulgakov, Henry Marsh, Atul Gawande, and Lisa Sanders. Other topics will include the philosophy of science (with a focus on Karl Popper), rationalism and romanticism (William James), and epistemology and scientism (Wittgenstein). 1 Credit."},{"title":"Multiracial Identities, Experiences, and Politics","description":"Mixed/multi-identities have been part of U.S. history since the nation’s birth, but the year 2020 marked only the third time in U.S. history that Americans were able to check more than one racial/ethnic category in the census. Today multiracial people in the US and other nations are gaining more visibility and recognition. With this visibility, however, comes inevitable scrutiny and ambivalence as evidenced by debates over the identity choices of high-profile multiracial people and the broader social and political implications of a growing social group. This course introduces students to contemporary discussions, debates and narratives surrounding multiracial people. By reading and discussing scholarly, literary, editorial, and visual texts, students critically examine the spaces multiracial people occupy in the U.S. and in other global contexts and explore the identity politics and perspectives that mark these experiences. Students also explore the growing narratives and spaces being created to build communities and express multi-subjectivities. Through class discussions, writing reflections, and a final project, students are encouraged to explore their own identities and subjectivities as they relate to larger discourses, current events, and narratives around race and intersecting identities."},{"title":"Rethinking Civil Rights and Black Power","description":"This course reconsiders the complex arguments and activities that have characterized the civil rights movement, thinking beyond the master narrative of Montgomery to Memphis, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. to understand Black agency, actions, and politics through historiography, documentary film, and art. Students read primary sources alongside secondary scholarship, focusing each week on an individual case study. Each week builds upon the past week to understand the civil rights movements in the United States, including in the urban North, the Midwest, and elsewhere. This course will answer the questions: did the Civil Rights Movement really just happen in the South? What was happening in other parts of the country? What made local movements similar or different? How can we use these movement histories to understand how we got to where we are today?"},{"title":"Race, Gender, and Class Inequities in the U.S.","description":"What are race, gender, and class? How do they operate individually or collectively to shape contemporary inequities? This course investigates these questions and the diverse methodological and theoretical approaches that scholars have taken to highlight matters affecting Black people and racially-minoritized populations in the United States. Likewise, it examines how persisting inequities are observed and experienced in the domains of education, employment, population health, food access, housing, incarceration, and policing, among others. No previous background in Sociology or any social science discipline is assumed."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2023":{"RA":{"amount":83,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.07,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":104,"upperBound":108},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":95,"upperBound":150}},"RW":{"amount":20,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.3,"upperBound":3.96},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":108,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":130,"upperBound":150}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/29-penn-state-university","name":"Penn State University","location":"United States of America","academicPeriod":{"start":"August 21, 2023","end":"December 15, 2022"},"language":{"ielts":null,"toefl":null,"det":null},"courses":[{"title":"Introductory Sociology","description":"SOC 1 provides perspectives and information useful in understanding all societies. The major theories (functionalism, conflict, and symbolic interactionism) and concepts provide the foundation upon which the course material rests. Students will learn how sociologists do research and explore tools for understanding the production of knowledge and for evaluating the validity of sociological assertions. Students will employ critical reasoning skills as they explore the nature and reality of culture and social structure, the formation of the social self and the salience of group identities and norms, social stratification and inequality (in the specific contexts of race, ethnicity, gender, and age), and the complexity of human social life and behavior. Sections of this course may include group research projects, debates, and library or internet-based research. Classification(s): Social and Behavioral Sciences"},{"title":"Race, Ethnicity and Culture","description":"SOC 119N focuses on historical patterns and current status of racial, ethnic and cultural groups and issues locally, nationally, and internationally. SOC 119 has three objectives. The course will introduce students to new ways of thinking about race, ethnicity and culture from the perspectives of the social sciences and humanities. Students will be able to compare and contrast differences between race, ethnicity and culture. They will be able to understand the extent and pervasiveness of racial, ethnic and cultural inequality and discrimination in the U.S. and explain how unequal systems impact different ancestry groups. Students will be able to compare historical causes and consequences of sociological processes such as immigration, assimilation and multiculturalism, and they will develop new ways of understanding how these processes are expressed in popular culture (e.g., art, music, literature) and intergroup dynamics. Students will also learn the intellectual tools for having more thoughtful conversations about the issues address in the class. By acquiring these tools, students will be able to formulate more thoughtful questions and responses when they engage others in everyday discussions about the many racial, ethnic and cultural factors and forces that pull people and groups together and push them apart. Finally, students will be able to more clearly explain how their identity reflects and shapes their life experiences as well as others in their racial and ethnic group(s)."},{"title":"Introduction to Art","description":"ARTH 100 provides an introduction to the history of art from prehistory to the present, through selected topics, rather than a comprehensive survey. Areas covered usually include prehistoric art, art of the Near East and Egypt, ancient Greek and Roman art, medieval art culminating with the Gothic, Renaissance art both in Italy and northern Europe, Baroque and Rococo art, and modern developments often highlighting Romanticism, Impressionism, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop, Feminist, and contemporary art. The course also introduces selected artistic traditions in Africa, Asia and the Americas. The course is designed to meet two principal goals. The first is to increase students’ powers of visual analysis and to help them build a critical vocabulary for discussing an art object’s medium, composition, style, and iconography. The second is to foster an understanding of the deep implication of the visual arts in their social and cultural contexts, both historical and contemporary. The course therefore involves significant material relating to political, economic and religious issues. It investigates problems in patronage, function, reception and censorship. It considers such intra- and cross-cultural issues as representations of gender and the incorporation of non-European art forms into the Western tradition. Requirements typically include examinations combining short answer and essay questions, and one paper based library research or intensive examination of an actual work of art."},{"title":"Anthropology, Ancestry, and You","description":"Anthropology, Ancestry, and You will integrate anthropology and genetics through the exploration of the students’ own genealogies and genomic ancestries. Engaging students in the investigation of their own origins will promote learning of science and social science. Instead of a textbook, students will have the opportunity to purchase a commercially available genetic ancestry test after receiving training on the potential risks and benefits of participating in personal genetic testing. This interdomain course will provide an opportunity for students from any major to explore topics including, ethical considerations of genetics research, human evolution and adaptation, DNA and inheritance, race, and identity."},{"title":"Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe","description":"ASTRO 6 is an introductory course that provides a broad introduction to many areas of Astronomy with qualitative descriptions of the dazzling and varied contents of the universe including the Sun and other stars, red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, supernovae, galaxies, dark matter, and more. The course will explore how these objects form and change and interact, how the whole universe formed and changes (cosmology), and where Earth fits in the vast scheme of things. Descriptions will build upon the basic physics of gravity, light, and atoms, and will be discussed in the context of the process of science as a robust and self-correcting way of learning and knowing that relies on making and testing predictions by gathering evidence."},{"title":"Environmental Science","description":"We are living in extraordinary times. Our numbers have now become so large, our power so great, and our consumption so rampant that we are despoiling our home. Indeed, over the past half-century environmental scientists have been calling attention to the deterioration of Earth’s atmosphere, Earth’s oceans, Earth’s forests and Earth’s soils, along with the loss of Earth’s biodiversity, from the tropics to the poles. The evidence is unequivocal: Planet Earth is under duress. Though we need Earth for our survival, Earth does not need us! So, will Earth shake us into oblivion or will we wake up, before it is too late, and become respectful members of Earth’s community of life? This is a critical question for humankind as a whole; and it is the reason that BISC 3 exists at Penn State. So it is that, in this course, we will explore the root causes of today’s environmental crisis and, in so doing, consider scientific, technological, sociological, psychological and personal responses to what is, arguable, the most significant crisis in the history of our species. If you commit to fully engaging with this course, you can expect to: 1-Discover how questions can be powerful catalysts for learning; 2-Grow in your ability to see both yourself and Planet Earth from new and liberating perspectives; 3-Appreciate the power of critical thinking and personal reflection as a means to both personal and global transformation 4-Realize that you, should you choose, can play a significant role in the healing of our world."},{"title":"Introduction to Spreadsheets and Databases","description":"Design, use, and programming of spreadsheets and data bases with applications from a range of disciplines."},{"title":"General View of Mathematics","description":"This course presents a general view of a number of mathematical topics to a non-technical audience, often relating the mathematical topics to a historical context, and providing students with an opportunity to engage with the mathematics at an introductory level. Although some variation in topics covered may take place among different instructors at different campuses, an example of such a course focuses on a number theory theme throughout the course, beginning with the Greeks’ view of integers, the concept of divisors, the calculation of greatest common divisors (which originates with Euclid), the significance of the prime numbers, the infinitude of the set of prime numbers (also known to the ancient Greeks), work on perfect numbers (which continues to be a topic of research today), and the work of Pythagoras and his famous Theorem. The course then transitions to the work of European mathematicians such as Euler and Gauss, including work on sums of two squares (which generalizes the Pythagorean Theorem), and then considering Euler’s phi function, congruences, and applications to cryptography."},{"title":"Classical Mythology","description":"CAMS 45 introduces the myths of ancient Greece and Rome as they are represented in the canonical works of Greek and Latin literature and art. Students become conversant in classical mythology by studying the stories of gods and goddesses and heroes and heroines. The course discusses the meaning and function of myths in their historical, religious, and literary contexts. It may also approach the interpretation of myth from different disciplinary perspectives (comparative mythology, critical theory, cultural anthropology, gender theory, history, philosophy, psychology, religion, or rhetoric). In addition, CAMS 45 gives students the opportunity to apply their knowledge and understanding of myth to the flourishing legacy of classical mythology in the literature, art, and culture of subsequent ages."},{"title":"Gender, Diversity and the Media","description":"This course is aimed at consumers of media in any form. It explores the relationship between the media and society through critical analysis of media and its role in education about and creation of social reality. Students research literature on human diversity issues in media representation. Students explore economic, political and social implications of media practice.

All sessions are conducted in English. ”Region” could be defined in various terms. In international relations, it generally indicates the multilateral groupings of neighboring nations. However, when it comes to the term regionalism, it suggests a functional relation that bundles multiple nations with their political, economic and cultural inheritance, often based on the geographical advantages. Region could be formed either inherently or arbitrary. Thus, the “Region/Regionalism” is a dynamic concept of geopolitics/economics, which rests between the global governance, the bilateral rational choice of the government, and people’s perceptions. This course specifically focuses on following agendas: 1)theory and practices of regionalism in East Asia, 2)security in Asia-Pacific region, 3)Japan’s foreign policy on regionalism."},{"title":"ENVIRONMENT RISK SCIENCE","description":"This lecture will focus on disaster risk as the key element of environmental risk, and will elaborate with case studies on different innovation examples in the field of housing, health, water, education and disaster recovery."},{"title":"MUSIC AND THE BRAIN ","description":"Music is ubiquitous in our environment.

How people make or do not make choices are, in fact, influenced not only by who they are, but also by the social environment where the decision-making takes place. Poor/good choice-making are the consequences of the following conditions which can be attributed to the individuals and/or the social environment: 1.Income constraints (environment/individual); and/or 2. Lack of knowledge (environment/individual); and/or 3. Lack of information (environment/individual); and/or 4. Lack of [good] choices (environment); and/or 5. Limited access to choices (environment/individual); and/or 6. Lack of freedom or Too much Freedom (environment); and/or 7. Laziness/ Decision [making] Fatigue (environment/ individual) Analysis of choice behaviors and how people make choices by considering these conditions above would help uncover where the problems may lie, thus improving the solution matters.

Instead, it matters much more to ensure that science is taken seriously. Advances in technology typically outpace the public’s version of the underlying science, leading to public distrust and confusion about the actual benefits and risks involved. Popular culture, particularly movies, often misrepresent scientific facts for entertainment and is usually viewed as part of the problem. However, some films offer excellent opportunities for teachers to draw connections and parallels between entertaining movie science and exciting real-world science. This course was designed for non-biology majors to show how biology themes were used to teach essential ideas. For example, whether DNA is sufficient to create life, how life evolves, what cloning is, and how bionics could improve/impact our future life. Students will additionally explore public misconceptions and naiveté about science perpetuated by movies, as well as the extent to which such films borrow from or, in some cases, even predict scientific facts. This course requires bi-weekly screenings of a feature-length movie before the lectures in the classroom. Films and topics are organized around biological themes.

Are there objective facts about the geometry of space, or are they in some way conventional? Are pastness, presentness, and futurity consistent notions? Do the past or future exist in the way the present exists? Do I have temporal parts as well as spatial parts if time is in many ways analogous to space? Is time travel possible? Is presentness compatible with special relativity given that the latter allows no absolute simultaneity? Could it be that the fundamental world is entirely timeless?"},{"title":"Edible Insects ","description":"This English course is expected to cover all social sciences related to “Insectivory”. Over the years, whether in the media, investment, or public policy, there has been an increasing interest in eating insects.

The current investigation of the ancient history must also be replaced into this larger framework of research, which puts the material culture and archaeological context on the same footing as the texts themselves. The sciences of the Antiquity comprise the classical philology (of which the main tasks are the study of the textual transmission and the establishment of texts), historical linguistics, palaeolography, rhetoric, epigraphy, papyrology, onomastics, chronology and calendars, numismatics, ceramology, field archaeology and iconography. However, as the classical philology remains the foundation of the Altertumswissenschaften and the knowledge of languages constitutes the very basis of philology, the present course aims at teaching ancient Greek and introducing to the history of the texts. Selective explorations into other branches of the sciences of the Antiquity will serve as learning auxiliaries. This course can hopefully also help students better understand, from its roots, the Western civilization from the Renaissance to the present day."},{"title":"Exploring Taiwan: natural environment and resources ","description":"Taiwan, an island country rich in biodiversity, located between Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea Plate, the geological structure is quite young. The frequent orogeny in Taiwan form many towering mountains, so even though Taiwan is in the tropical and subtropical zone, the temperate climate can still be found at high altitudes. In addition, the creatures, adapted to different climates, are able to survive in Taiwan. Taiwan is also known from high percentage of endemic species. This is because in the Ice Age, Taiwan was connected to Eurasia. After the Ice Age, Taiwan was isolated by the ocean, and many lives gradually evolved into endemic species on the island. Nowadays, the proportion of endemic species in Taiwan is about 71% in mammals, 17% in birds, 22% in reptiles, 31% in amphibian, 19% in freshwater fish, 25% in plants, and 60% in insects.

To facilitate a hands-on appreciation of those attributes, the course includes a hypothetical exercise designed to challenge us to look at peace efforts from a variety of real-world perspectives."},{"title":"The Indigenous Economy","description":"Aboriginal people have been living in Australia for over 60,000 years and the Indigenous economy has sustained their culture and society for that whole period. This course seeks to use a range of basic economic concepts to understand the nature and operation of that economy in order to critically assess various policy options for effectively addressing the significant socioeconomic challenges facing Indigenous Australians in the modern economy. The inherent complexities of these challenges means that students will be also exposed to a range of insights from other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, anthropology and demography) to assess effective policy options that are likely to require a combination of equity or fairness considerations with an efficient allocation of resources."},{"title":"First Peoples' Experiences and Ways of Being: Resilience, Agency, Resurgence and Rights","description":"This course focuses on First Peoples’ perspectives on experiences since the British commenced colonisation of this place. Students develop understanding and insights into some of the diverse perspectives, ways of knowing and being, and experiences of First Peoples since colonisation across this continent, its islands and seas. In this course, we will focus on selected significant events, reflect on the resilience and agency of First Peoples until now, and learn more about the contemporary context of First Peoples’ resurgence. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the lived reality of First Peoples’ rights in Australia, and reflect upon this in a global content. This is an introductory course in Australian Indigenous Studies that centre First Peoples’ diverse perspectives and that critically engages with scholarly and popular narratives about key events."},{"title":"The Origins of Political Order in Asia","description":"This course traces the historical development of Asia’s diverse political systems. It examines underlying geo-political realities and their implications for political structure and focusses on the religious and political systems of thought that have shaped Asian political systems, especially regarding leadership, the family, ethnicity, social class and age. The course commences with the emergence of civilization in Asia, examines political structures as they were influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity,  the transformation of ethnic and national identities brought about in the era of western imperialism, and the assertion of new political ideals inspired by communism, liberalism, religions and reinterpretations of the past."},{"title":"Natural Resource Conflicts in Asia and the Pacific","description":"Violent conflicts over natural resources are an enduring feature of social and political life at different scales and levels of organisation. The inter-state and geopolitical dimensions of conflicts over resources such as oil and water loom large in the popular imaginary. However, resource conflicts in the global South are predominantly fought internally, within the boundaries of the nation-state. Indeed, according to the United Nations, at least 40 percent of internal conflicts globally are related to natural resources. It is these sorts of conflicts that are the focus of this course. A striking conundrum lies at the heart of the inquiry: rather than  contributing to peace and prosperity, empirical research demonstrates that natural resource wealth increases the likelihood that a country will experience internal armed conflict. How and why is this the case? What about the role of resource scarcity as driver of violent conflict in developing-country contexts? What sort of policy responses and interventions are available? How might natural resource wealth contribute to peace rather than to conflict? What is the role of political and economic contestation in these struggles over land and natural resources? The course will be structured around a series of case studies drawn from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. A political ecology framework will be applied to the analysis of how land and different types of resource complexes  – including mining, oil and gas, forestry, and oil palm – can be implicated in violent conflict. Alongside these case studies, students will undertake their own analysis of a natural resource conflict in which they will be attentive to the role of different actors – especially the state, communities and corporations – and to questions of scale, power and identity. The course will have a very strong research-led approach to teaching and learning. In addition to core expertise housed in SSGM, it draws upon expertise from other parts of the Coral Bell School and the Crawford School. In addition to the involvement of some of these scholars in class room teaching, the assessment for the course will enable students to engage with them in innovative ways."},{"title":"Australian Political History","description":"This course examines Australian politics from a historical perspective. It explores the foundation and working of democracy, the formation and transformation of the party system, and the relationship of politics to broader changes in society. The first part follows a chronological structure, beginning with traditional Indigenous government and extending through the colonial era to the present day, while the second examines a range of themes such as federation, nationalism and republicanism, women, gender and politics, rural politics, Indigenous politics and the media. The aim is to provide students with a historical grounding in the main political trends, institutions, personalities, ideas and ideologies."},{"title":"International Relations in the Asia-Pacific","description":"This course will apply basic international relations theories encompassing realist, liberal-internationalist and constructivist perspectives to ongoing and emerging political dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region. It complements comparative political perspectives on regional governance by applying state-centric and key sub-state based perspectives on understanding how the region ‘matters’ in a global context. Various perspectives on international political economics, foreign policy analysis, international security and regional/international institutions will supplement the theoretical perspectives that underwrite the subject’s conceptual approach."},{"title":"Reading Popular Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Studies","description":"An introduction to the field of cultural studies, this unit progresses through a “circuit of culture”. Using this model, it introduces the key concepts and practices of representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Two areas of contemporary culture will be of particular interest to this unit: (1) issues surrounding advertising, corporate power and globalisation, and (2) debates about the representation of gender and sexuality in the media and popular culture. In the first half of the course, students will learn to use semiotics, a method that is widely used by cultural and feminist critics to study how meanings are produced in images and texts. Coupling semiotics with theories of identity, subjectivity, ideology and discourse students will analyse power relationships in popular culture. Students will also become familiar with debates relating to production and consumption. Upon completing the course requirements, students will have experience in applying core methods and theories analytically, and will be able to demonstrate critical reflection on key concepts shared by cultural and gender studies.s."},{"title":"Contemporary Australian Indigenous Music Studies","description":"The Contemporary Australian Indigenous Music Studies course is designed to give students the knowledge and skills to interact with Australian Indigenous music in its contexts inclusive of narratives and issues pertinent to the music and its peoples. Students will examine a range of protocols and TCEs (traditional cultural expressions) that serve to inform them in their research and practical assignments and/or engagements with Australian Indigenous music. A comprehensive study of contemporary Australian Indigenous music styles and aural analysis of the same serves to introduce students to a widening cultural biography and a living culture with which they can have relationship"},{"title":"Australian Political Institutions","description":"Australia is one of the world’s oldest liberal democracies. This longevity is due, in part, to institutional design. A close examination of Australia’s political institutions reveals both stability and evolution from their original design. This course explores this stability and change dynamic through an examination of the Australian political system. It provides students with an overview of the cleavages that characterize Australia and the institutions that attempt to manage them. This course concentrates on formal political institutions paying particular attention to the constitution, institutions of government (e.g. High Court, Parliament, federalism), and electoral competition. We will also compare Australia to other advanced democracies enhancing our understanding of the Australian state."},{"title":"Traditional Australian Indigenous Cultures, Societies and Environment","description":"Pre-invasion Indigenous cultures have long been seen as the social, economic and ecological prototype of the hunting and gathering way of life. The aim of this course is to convey a basic anthropological understanding of the customary or ‘traditional’ practices and beliefs as they were at the threshold of colonisation and to critically engage with representations while respecting First Peoples’ insights and perspectives. We will focus on relationality, and in particular the multiple ways in which connectivity underpins Indigenous worldviews. Exploring these issues also means exploring the intellectual struggles non-Indigenous people have had and continue to have to come to terms with Indigenous societies and cultures, as well as understanding why and how Indigenous social and cultural practices capture the scholarly imagination. ."},{"title":"Global Citizen: Culture, Development and Inequality","description":"Just how involved are we are on a daily basis with the processes, the politics, the social and economic relations and the other formations that constitute this complex and slightly scary thing called globalisation? Beginning with some of the things that are closest and most familiar to us – including the clothes on our backs – we’re going to start at the ground and trace upwards the links that attach us to far off countries, economies, sites of production and fellow humans. In this way, we will trace our own map of the world system and get some sort of critical understanding of how we slot into it. In the process, we will ask ‘Is there a more ethical way for us to approach some of those core global practices in which we all participate: consumption, tourism, inhabiting the city, and using the internet and social media?’ How, in this immensely complex context, are we to be good global citizens? In the process of doing this we will learn the fundamental concepts anthropologists and other social scientists use to make sense of globalisation’s exciting new cultural and social forms and its not so exciting new forms of exploitation and inequality. The focus will be on understanding the language of the anthropology of globalisation, and the practical and critical application of its key concepts to real life global issues. We will use an innovative team based learning approach in which students help each other workshop the weekly readings and carry out critical and interpretive activities in class based on real life case studies."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":109,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.12,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":96,"upperBound":108},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":80,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.49,"upperBound":3.96},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":150}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":16,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.36,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":98,"upperBound":100},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":115,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":9,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.36,"upperBound":3.99},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":98,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/32-the-university-of-adelaide/","name":"The University of Adelaide","location":"Adelaide, Australia","academicPeriod":{"start":"July 24, 2023","end":"November 18, 2023"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":79},"courses":[{"title":"Climate Change","description":"Climate change is the greatest challenge for humanity in the 21st century and is particularly compelling for Australia. This course addresses this issue with reference to Australian and international case studies. In order to understand current global climate change, the course examines the record of historic and prehistoric climate before considering the scientific prognosis for climate change as summarised in the scientific reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Consequently through public policy the state seeks solutions to reduce the negative impacts of these and similar harms. In this course you will explore the ways in which such social problems become defined. This includes an exploration of the different worldviews and theoretical perspectives that shape how we see social problems and the effects of different ways of defining social problems across time and cultures. Through learning to analyse how issues are problematized, you will gain insights into the social framing of contemporary policy initiatives. Key to this course is the focus on a range of social problems and the use of sociological theory to understand the social-economic processes surrounding the construction of issues as social problems and attempts by policymakers to address them."},{"title":"Cities and Sustainability","description":"As cities grow and develop their environmental impacts are concentrated locally but have impacts across the globe.

More specifically, the course introduces concepts of power, statecraft, diplomacy, foreign policy, political economy and international security, and examines the evolution of international relations in the 20th and 21st centuries. The course combines the study of concepts and theories with a range of questions about global politics, including: Why bother with theory? Have we reached ‘the end of history’? Why is the world divided in nation-states? What factors influence the foreign policy of states? Is the sovereign state in decline? What is the ‘new world (dis)order’? Are we experiencing a ‘clash of civilisations’? Why do wars occur? Is there such a thing as a just war? What are the causes of terrorism? How is the world organised economically? Do transnational corporations rule the world? Is free trade the solution to global poverty? What are the main global threats of the 21st century? These and other questions will be explored through the examination of a wide range of contemporary issues and case studies, including: the rise of China; the resurgence of Russia; the nuclear threat posed by North Korea; the tensions in the South China Sea; the role of the United Nations; the future of the European Union, particularly after Brexit; the increasing power of transnational corporations, such as Wal-Mart, Google and Facebook; the terrorist threat posed by Al-Qaeda and Islamic State; the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Palestine; the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar; the role of the United States in global politics, particularly since the election of Donald Trump; the impact of global pandemics (such as COVID-19); and the multiple threats posed by climate change in the 21st century."},{"title":"Cyber-Politics: Politics & the Internet Revolution","description":"The course examines how the digital age has transformed politics around the world. Information and communication technologies have deeply changed both the private and public spheres, the internet has radically changed the way people communicate with each other and interact with the state and private corporations. It has reshaped our economies, and created new opportunities for political engagement and organization. Citizens use the internet to organise protests and boycotts, but the internet is also a space where individuals may become radicalised. It provides a democratised platform for the production and consumption of information, but also lends itself to the proliferation of “fake news”, echo chambers and hate speech. Governments attempt to enact laws that control, censor, or monitor online interactions. But private corporations are similarly interested to control and utilize the internet to gather data on current and future consumers, and to exploit commercial opportunities. Similar opportunities are also sought by criminal actors, who seek to use the internet to pursue criminal, aggressive and terrorist activities. How, then, ought the internet be governed? Who should have authority to control internet access and content? In this course, we will explore this complex web of relations, dangers and opportunities by tackling questions such as: should the internet be censored, and by whom? Should hate speech be prohibited? Who should control access to the internet? Should Facebook be nationalised? What is the value of privacy? What impact is the internet, and particularly social media, having on the human experience? What is cybersecurity and how do we achieve it? Does internet communication favour populist and authoritarian leaders? How do these issues relate to one another and to conceptions of network neutrality more generally?"},{"title":"Empowerment, Gender & Community Development","description":"This course investigates crucial interconnections between empowerment, gender and community development, examining the ways in which gender and community participation, influence development policies, processes and programs; and the extent to which development, gendered relations, and communities are transformed in the process. It examines key concepts and theoretical frameworks of development with a particular focus on the intersection of development terms such as community, participation, sustainability, gender, equality & empowerment, in light of current issues in development discourse and critical analysis of development practice and policy. In the course, then, we explore the use of certain concepts and ideals, such as empowerment, gender equality, sustainable development, as well as central issues in development practice and policy. These include the interaction between poverty and gender; the empowerment of women through work and microfinance/credit; and the proposed empowerment of communities (and countries) through the ‘girl effect’. The complexities of corporate community development are also examined, as is the practice of tourism (volunteer/cultural) as sustainable community development; the issue of gendered violence, legislation and human rights at the level of local communities; and an analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals from the standpoint of gender and the community."},{"title":"Sustaining work and business for a just society","description":"This course provides students with a foundation in the broad field of axiology, introducing concepts and theories of human values and ethics. This will take a particular focus on the challenges of working in and managing different types of business, public, third sector and informal organisations. The course is structured around individual and group level analyses of behaviour and decisions, emphasising the importance of personal, group and corporate responsibility. It emphasises the important tripartite approach to ethics, equipping candidates to systematize, defend, and recommend concepts of right and wrong behaviour. Classes will draw from all the business disciplines (ie finance, accounting, management, marketing and international business), presenting participants with complex moral and ethical challenges drawn from real-life and hypothetical situations. These will be explored with a theoretical backdrop, drawing from axiological theory and other relevant and important topic areas (such as leadership, decision making, power and conflict, diversity, culture and professional ethics). Such analyses will engage with various influences on behaviour, especially relating to explicit and implicit codes of behaviour (eg regulatory, professional, organisational and socio-cultural). Tutorial work and assessment will involve activities such as reflection, discussion, debate and role plays using key concepts such as cognitive and emotive dissonance, stereotyping, fundamental attribution error and tools such as the Johari window, transactional analysis and the repertory grid.

Asia and the World provides all students, but especially those doing International Studies and Asian Studies, with a basic introduction to notions of Asia. Many things which are taken for granted as being Western, often have their origins in the East in some way. This influence extends to language, hamburgers, philosophical ideas and ways of illustrating what we see. This influence is not limited to the ancient past. Today Asian pop culture is reshaping Western pop culture and ideas and products from Asia are changing our lives in fundamental ways even if the origins are not obvious. Asia and the World highlights the irony of how reactions to Asia shaped Europe’s destiny and how its inventions and ideas have been adapted by Western states and often used to then dominate Asia in the colonial period. The contemporary rise of independent Asian nation states is reviewed and contextualised and the processes which obscure Asian influence are explained. Your view of why Australian/Western history and culture are the way they are may well change the way you see the world."},{"title":"Sound & Media","description":"This course focuses on the following content: (1) the use of sound in the media, with attention to film, television, games; (2) the concepts of montage and collage and their application to sound for media; (3) media and sound editing concepts and techniques; (4) detailed scene analysis of examples from films, television, games; (5) psychological and aesthetic aspects of sound in media; (6) the role of sound in the construction of the media; (7) technological basis of sound in the media; (8) historical development of sound in the media."},{"title":"Psychology IB","description":"This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts and core topics within contemporary psychology.

As the world is becoming increasingly urbanised and citizens are becoming more affluent, people are turning towards unhealthy “Western-style” diets characterised by high-energy, nutrient-poor processed and refined foods. This shift in dietary patterns has led to an increased morbidity burden due to obesity and other non-communicable diseases. Thus, there is an urgent need to address diet-related health problems created by under/over-nutrition and poor dietary practices by tackling the underlying scientific, technological, policy, regulatory, cultural, and economic determinants, and obstacles to creating healthy food and food systems. Human diets inextricably link health and environmental sustainability. The present food system is one of the main causes of resource depletion and unacceptable environmental impacts, and is responsible for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, meeting nutritional needs for improved health while staying within “planetary boundaries” is the biggest challenge for humanity. Solving the problem of providing enough healthy food for all while maintaining environmental health requires a radical shift to a global food system that needs to draw on knowledge and skills from the many disciplines of both Science and Humanities. Eminent scholars will teach students from across the full range of disciplines in arts, biosciences, nutrition, medicine, agricultural science, and economics, plus practitioners from the food, nutrition, farm industry and the natural resource sector.

What one does with these ‘facts’ and ‘truths’ is equally important. What we claim to know may be helpfully understood in its emergence from and application to highly complex and seemingly intractable problems. Addressing such ‘wicked problems’ thoughtfully and collaboratively can reveal the nature of knowledge: how it is generated, how it is applied and contested, and what purposes it serves. Research areas in the Humanities, The Arts and the Social Sciences (HASS) as well as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will be introduced and problematised. Building on the ideas or C. S. Peirce, John Dewey and Matthew Lipman, this interdisciplinary subject will therefore focus on developing effective communities of inquiry, where the use of critical but cumulative talk is favored and where good questioning, in‐depth knowledge, sound reasoning and self‐reflection is applied to addressing and critically appraising wicked problems. To this end, the subject will examine wicked problems arising from a wide range of disciplinary areas and cultural perspectives, including: climate change skepticism, Indigenous knowledges, fake news, and major societal issues and innovations arising from recent advances in Science, Technology, and the Arts."},{"title":"Drugs that Shape Society ","description":"Drugs that Shape Society is a compelling story of drugs that provides insight to us as individuals and as a society. Drugs impact our lives in many different ways. Social responses to their use have shaped our laws, the health system, commerce – even foreign policies. In Australia the use of therapeutic drugs is carefully regulated to maintain cost and safety, some recreational drugs are taxed heavily to provide government income, while others are banned and huge costs are incurred attempting to prevent their use. Other countries have a different blend of risk, responsibility and regulation. Drugs that Shape Society is a University breadth subject available to all second-year students. Using a case-study approach, students will explore the scientific, social, historical and legal issues associated with alcohol, opiates, tobacco, penicillin and thalidomide. Any drug use carries risk – medical, social, ethical and legal. Who has been, or is, responsible for managing that risk? What is the role of policy and regulation in minimising risk and assigning responsibility? These questions will be explored by consideration of the scientific, ethical and economic factors determining drug development; the addictive nature of certain drugs, the striking contrasts between drug marketing strategies, ranging from illegal dealing to professional multi-facted advertising; and the risks associated with legal and illicit drug use and abuse. Lectures will provide basic information about the processes leading to the development of the drugs, their mechanism of action, the historical context of their impact on society, and how this has been handled legally. Tutorials and small group work will allow students to discuss and debate the issues raised and to put them into the context of their own experiences."},{"title":"Biology of Australian Flora & Fauna ","description":"This subject will introduce you to the natural history of Australia from the Cretaceous to the present and the influence of Australia’s First Peoples and Europeans on Australia’s environments.

However, a broader definition which understands globalization as an economic, social, and cultural process of growing communication, interdependence, and change suggests that it dates back to the early modern era, when the Atlantic expansion of Europe in particular produced ever closer links of growing intercontinental interdependence. This “first globalization” led to the exploitation of entire peoples and the forced migration of others, as well as to different forms of contact among diverse cultures, which gave rise to a wide range of extra-local mixtures, hybrids and conflicts. In order to understand these and other transformations which led to the hegemony of the West in the nineteenth century, this course analyzes a lengthy process whose main protagonists were, first, Portugal and Spain, followed by the north Atlantic states.

How can the urban landscape be read as a myriad of dynamic sites? What do these sites, in turn, tell us about past traumas and present-day issues? This course aims to enable the students to get to know a number of Berlin museums focusing on key aspects of memory of the Second World War and Post-WWII migration, using anthropological methods. Students are encouraged to critically analyze these representations within larger theoretical frameworks of “self” and “other” constructions, exploring the role of museums in rendering such constructions visible."},{"title":"Conceptualizing German Identity: From Colonial towards Post-Colonial Diversity","description":"This course is designed to introduce students to the wide interdisciplinary perspective on diversity, politics of belonging and the status of citizenship of people within the African Diaspora in Berlin. Historically, the settlement of migrant groups and the formation of minority ethnic groups have changed the socio-cultural, political and economic fabric of receiving societies. As a result, the relationship between migration, social cohesion, and national German identity has become an increasingly contentious political issue. The course will travel through the hidden geography of the so-called Afrikanisches Viertel in Berlin and focus on issues around public space, monuments, and street names from the 1960s to the present day that have anchored German colonialism. We will consider the relationship between colonialism and white supremacy in Germany, whilst examining the ongoing debate around how German (anti-)racism has been influenced by earlier colonial ideology and practice. We will turn to the resurgence of colonialism as a theme in recent literature and historiography and examine the state of play in contemporary (international) debates about the colonial past. There will be ample examples from which students can draw to develop a toolbox of critical skills and historical examples through which to understand German colonialism and how it has become a determining factor in contemporary discussions of intersectional inequalities. Berlin will be used as a case study for themes covered, however, students are encouraged to reflect on their own identities and the expressions of various identities around the city."},{"title":"Asia in Berlin","description":"Berlin is a multi-cultural city with a diverse cultural life.

Urban performance in tourism","description":"In this course, we explore the contemporary utilisation of typical Berlin discourses in the context of tourism and city marketing, such as Berlin-specific subcultures, economic developments à la Smart City, political activism and environmental concerns for tourism. By testing different approaches to experiencing and sensing the city, we critically examine the basis of diverse ways of “knowing Berlin”. We will ask: what makes the tourist perspective so intriguing and specific? Who profits from this way of experiencing a city? How is cultural diversity and complexity practically channelled into profitable tourism sites and activities? In small groups and workshop-based, we will develop and analyse contents and methods of explorative walking performances based on contemporary urban discourses and projects.

But even small businesses participate in international trade today. The integration of national economies and the elimination of barriers of trade no longer allow a solely national view on this development. With the growing importance of international commerce, the need for an “International Economic Law” arises. Numerous regulations and agreements concern international trade and investment, but the legal framework of international economy remains indefinite. The rise of international commerce necessitates furthermore, the need for an international effective judicial protection, which goes beyond the traditional national barriers of civil and commercial litigation. International litigation and arbitration play an important role in the realization of rights and judicial protection of companies and consumers alike. In this course, common principles of International Economic Law will be examined by analyzing leading decisions by international courts. Furthermore international and domestic legal statutes in all aspects of economic law will be examined and discussed. Therefore, a substantial part of the course will be dedicated to the discussion of cases, legal statutes and reading materials."},{"title":"Being Watched: History and Contemporary Culture of Surveillance","description":"What does it mean to live in a surveillance society?

It is about the control of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases. As a Biomedical Sciences or Medical student, studying global health and infectious diseases is relevant. Challenges of global health are at the intersect of molecular, clinical, epidemiological, economic and other socio-behavioural sciences. This course reflects this multidisciplinary nature and offers you a broad scope of methods, instruments and techniques stemming from the different disciplines. The course is designed for you to acquire theoretical knowledge, practical insights and hands-on skills, e.g. through lab courses and literature review exercises. You will also learn how to translate scientific knowledge into policy recommendations and to deliver these in writing and through oral presentations in English. In week 1 you will be introduced to global health and infectious diseases. Throughout the course you will gradually expand your view and breadth of analysis, from a molecular and methodological perspective (week 2-5), and patient and clinical perspective (weeks 6-12), to a health systems and policy perspective (week 13-19). From week 13 onwards, you will work on your Global Health in Action project, a parallel group project for which you will study in-depth a highly relevant issue in global health. During the minor you will engage with leading researchers at Radboud and meet professionals working in Global Health and Infectious Diseases at public health institutions, knowledge institutions, and non-governmental organizations. This course entails the following learning objectives: 1. Critically assess biological aspects related to the transmission of infectious diseases that are of global significance. 2.

To have collective decision making between institutes and hospitals concerning infectious diseases and outbreaks , it is necessary to have knowledge about prevention, disease characteristics, containment, modelling, sequencing, rational antimicrobial treatment and control of infectious diseases in both hospital and community settings. Additionally, differences between communities are key in understanding the epidemiology of an outbreak, for example hesitance and variety in low/high resources facilities. Outbreak management, comparable to what we have experienced during the coronavirus outbreak, will be discussed. This course prepares students for a research and clinical internship in the area of infectious diseases and infection control. All knowledge gained through the varied forms of education, will be directly translated and used in a research team project. The course uses various interactive and experience-based teaching manners, such as lectures, group work, presentations, joining a point prevalence study in the hospital, a table-top exercise on outbreak control in the hospital, a serious on outbreak control in the community a serious game, and several excursions (TB clinic, RIVM). This course entails the following learning objectives: 1. Gain profound understanding of how genetic diversity and antigenic variation in infectious diseases is related to infectious disease pathogenesis, transmission and evolution. 2. Participate in a multidisciplinary antibiotic stewardship team by having active knowledge of the working mechanisms of antimicrobials, knowledge on when to use which antibiotic, and how micro-organisms can counter antimicrobials (antibiotic resistance). 3. Develop and present hospital infection control programs by understanding the concept of hospital infection prevention and control on a patient level, including the understanding of different indications for patient isolation, different types of isolation and the criteria for ending isolation. 4.

The course will cover what AI is and an example of how AI techniques can be applied to an existing software system. In the part on probability theory, different aspects will be covered including probability distributions, conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem. In this part of the module, you will learn how to derive probabilities, as well as how to reason and calculate with them. In the societal impact part of the module, we will focus specifically on how recent developments in cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence and neuroscience raise various practical issues for individuals and society. Moreover, we will apply a philosophical approach (conceptual analysis, ethical discussion, identification and clarification of intuitions, basic assumptions and potential societal implications) in order to address the fundamental questions underlying these practical issues. Finally, we will practice how cognitive scientists could (and should) contribute to the public debate, thereby assisting responsible decision making about (un)desired research directions and applications of resulting technologies such as cognitive enhancement, robots and brain-computer interfaces.

In recent decades, national borders have become less important. In economic, political and cultural areas, transnational networks have emerged that take little or no account of the traditional territorial boundaries of nation states. This is a positive development for people who have the resources and capabilities to use these networks. However, a large part of the world population is cut off from these global networks and their benefits. Many people are well aware of structural injustice and better alternatives, but rarely have the opportunity to improve their situation. Against this background the question arises what ‘justice’ can mean in a world that increasingly becomes smaller. To what extent can we realize our ideals of freedom, equality, solidarity, and sustainability in a world in which individuals and communities are increasingly dependent on each other? Are there principles of global justice? And if so, who has the duty to comply with these principles, and which international structures do we need to guarantee them? These questions are dealt with on the basis of a problem-based approach that looks at current themes such as poverty and socio-economic inequality, international trade, social responsibility of multinationals, distribution of natural resources, and climate justice. Test information Students are required to write an essay and to give a presentation. The final result will be composed out of the following elements: – Examination: 50% – Presentation: 30% – Essay: 20%. Philosophy of International law This course provides a discussion of the foundations of and critical approaches to human rights. On successful completion of this course, you will be able to: • explain different philosophical approaches to human rights; • explain the strengths and weaknesses of the various foundations of and challenges to human rights; • relate philosophical debates on human rights to current issues in human rights law; • form an opinion on a current human rights issue, using philosophical approaches to human rights. Since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 international law has recognized an increasing number of human rights. Political activists in the North and the South appeal to human rights and so do many states (even when their actions violate human rights law). Yet, despite becoming a global ‘moral lingua franca’, human rights remain controversial. Various social movements and thinkers call for the recognition of new human rights, such as rights of the peasants, LGBTI+-rights and collective rights. However, classic liberals, and states such as the US, have argued against what they see as the ‘erosion of human rights’ and want to limit human rights to a core of political and civil rights. More fundamentally, the legitimacy of human rights is hotly debated. Marxist, feminist and postcolonial critics argue that human rights do not represent universal values, but that these rights propagate an individualist and market-driven way of life. While some critics call for a transformation of human rights, others urge us to drop human rights altogether. These debates raise all sorts of urgent questions: Are human rights genuinely universal, and, if so, what is the most appropriate foundation of human rights? Is it desirable to make room within international law for new rights? Are human rights really a defense against oppression or do human rights serve the powerful and deepen injustice? And, if we are to move beyond the (current) human rights framework, what alternatives exist to address injustice? Tests: Take home essay Global Labor Justice At the end of this course, you are able to: • Distinguish and describe several perspectives vis-à-vis the relationship between human rights and religion, reflect on them, and take an argued position of your own; • Differentiate between the different generations of human rights, and explain the tensions between particular human rights, especially when it comes to the acknowledgement of religious and other normative perspectives; • Explain and illustrate how human rights culture is induced or reduced by the convictions of normative communities and religious traditions; • Recognize and describe specific contributions to human rights discourse coming from religious or normative communities; • Apply concepts coming from the social sciences and religious studies to the study of human rights; • Explain the context of contemporary issues in which human rights discourse and religion seem to clash. The judicial inscription of human rights in legislation and regulation (i.e. the legality of human rights), is important, but the extent to which people at large agree with these positivized human rights and support them (i.e. the legitimacy of human rights) is at least equally meaningful. Acceptance and support of human rights is not only defined by individual circumstances, but it is also determined by the values and norms of the particular group(s) individuals belong to. These groups can be both religious and secular/philosophical in nature. In this course, we explore the relationship between human rights discourse and such normative communities. Is religion good for the development of a human rights culture, or does religion hinder the application of human rights? This is a question that has been and is still discussed in philosophical as well as religious circles. In the first part of the course, we will encounter several different perspectives on this question, taking both extremes as their starting point, and students will be challenged to argue for their own position. In the second part of this course, we will discuss contemporary contexts from around the world in which human rights discourse and normative communities are interacting or at odds with each other. We will get to know and apply concepts from the social sciences and religious studies, such as globalization, identity politics and fundamentalism to understand these situations better. Studying these contexts raises the question of whether human rights are and should be universal or not. Test information The examination is based on a written exam at the end of the term. A reflection paper on the student’s own position concerning the relationship between religion and human rights is also part of the examination. Paper: 30% Written end-of-term exam: 70%"},{"title":"Module Ecology and Sustainability  ","description":"The Radboud Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies offers three modules for IISMA students. The modules comprise three courses in the Philosophy, Politics and Society bachelor programme. You can only take a course (5 ECTS) if you also take the two associated courses during the same semester. An entire module will be 15 ECTS. In order to secure a diverse population at max three Iisma students can be allowed for a module. This module comprises three courses – Ecophilosophy in the Anthropocene At the end of this course, you will have the ability to: • identify the key debates, central issues and dominant philosophical positions with regard to the Anthropocene; • critically assess the philosophical robustness and soundness of these philosophcal positions, and to identify options for their improvement; • distinguish, assess and identify the basic eco-philosophical concepts and theories in the philosophical debates on the Anthropocene; • critically apply these eco-philosophical concepts and theories to concrete current ecological and geopolitical issues. There is hardly any question about it: ‘the environment’ dominates all the social, economic, political and even individual agendas in our days – climate change and rising sea levels, biodiversity and species extinction, pollution, sustainability, energy transition: there is no escape. For philosophers, these issues raise the most profound question in at least three areas: metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy – the three areas represented in the ‘Ecology and Sustainability’ module. This particular course, ‘Ecophilosophy in the Anthropocene’, focuses on the Anthropocene as a new way of understanding the global ecological crisis, i.e., as the geological epoch following the Holocene, in which the human (anthropos) has become the most important geological factor, from now on crucially determining the fate of the biosphere. In general, this course deals with the metaphysical, ontological and anthropological implications of the Anthropocene and what it means for rethinking the human condition. It also reflects on the widespread recognition of an ecological turn in philosophy and the humanities more generally. The course consists of two parts. In the first part we will first take a look at the scientific debate on the Anthropocene and then reflect philosophically on some of the central issues, in particularly focusing on (socio)ecological complexity and on the discussions around biodiversity and extinction, including the possibility of human extinction. We will also introduce students to geophilosophy and demonstrate its usefulness for reflecting on the Anthropocene. Authors to be discussed in this part include Gilles Deleuze, Michel Serres, Andreas Malm and Timothy Morton. In the second part we will first present an overview of the prevailing narratives on the Anthropocene and then reflect on what these imply for rethinking the Earth and the relation between humanity and the Earth in light of the necessity of re-earthing humanity so as to ensure the possibility of human habitation on the planet. It will then focus on the technological dimension of the Anthropocene through a discussion of the notion of the technosphere as the new decisive geosphere, both on what this means from an energetic perspective and from the question of human agency and responsibility. Finally it will reflect on the necessity of a new terrestrial ethos in relation to the question concerning technology. Authors to be discussed in this part include Clive Hamilton, Bruno Latour, Peter Sloterdijk and Bernard Stiegler. Tests Paper -Political Ecology After this course, you will have the ability to: • identify the possible political and social implications of eco-philosophical positions on environmental ethics, environmental collective action, and the relevant moral subjects of environmental thought; • critically assess the philosophical robustness and soundness of these views, and to identify options for their improvement; • distinguish, assess and identify the influence of basic eco-philosophical concepts and theories in ‘green’ political and political–economic thought; • do the same with policy-informing scientific reports – and to identify and qualify any form of bias in such reports. There is hardly any question about it: ‘the environment’ dominates all the social, economic, political and even individual agendas in our days – climate change and rising sea levels, biodiversity and species extinction, pollution, sustainability, energy transition. There is no escape. For philosophers, these issues raise the most profound question in at least three areas: metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy – the three areas represented in the ‘Ecology and Sustainability’ module. This particular course, ‘Political Ecology’, focuses on debates on sustainability and environmental policy, economics and politics. Sustainability refers to the way in which resources of the planet can be used in such a way that needs and demands of current generations can be met while also guaranteeing the needs and rights of future generations of humans. The sustainability debate focuses, in other words, on the way in which human societies impact the global ecosystem and aims to find new concepts and understandings of politics and economy that reflect an understanding of the dependence of human well-being on the global ecosystems. Concrete topics include: Ecology and economy: new economic models (circular and steady state economy, bio-based economy, degrowth, commons, permaculture, etc.); Environmental and intergenerational justice; ecologism versus liberalism versus republicanism; ecomodernism; Climate politics and the IPPC process. – Critique of Green Ideology At the end of this course, you will have the ability to: • identify key issues and debates within (critique of) green ideology • situate critique of green ideology to related fields, such as ecocriticism and ecofeminism • critically asses the concepts of ecology and sustainability, and identify options for their salvageability; • critically apply these eco-philosophical concepts and theories to concrete current ecological, social and (geo)political issues. Content There is hardly an organization, business or government left that hasn’t put “sustainability” front and centre, our own university included. In the meantime, as the latest IPCC reports attest to, the climate crisis is deepening. What are we talking about when we talk about sustainability? And what do we aim to sustain? How to distinguish mute and/or strategic references to a sustainable world and greenwashing, from attempts to actually change things? In this course we explore the genealogy of the concept of sustainability, as well as that of ecology, and their functioning within “green ideology.” In the first part of the course we trace the concept of ecology from its original conceptualization in the work of German zoologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, its development in the 20th century, both in science and the environmental movement from the 1950’s onwards, to the “explosion of ecologies” that is currently taking place, that some argue requires a general ecology and even concerns an “ecologization of thinking.” In the second part of the course we engage with the concept of sustainability. Here we mainly focus on the transition of the concept from the 1970s onwards. We trace how it changed from a critical concept that challenged economic hegemony, reminding us of ecology and of the limits to growth, into “sustainable development” – more of a managerial concept than a critical (eco-)political one – to the “empty signifier” it seems to have become. Can the critical kernel of sustainability be salvaged? In the third part we explore the functioning of these two concepts within green ideology, also addressing related ideals such as circular (bio-)economy, green growth and green capitalism, and notions such as resilience and regeneration. Do they really challenge the status quo or in fact strengthen it? In order to answer that question and find what a critique of green ideology requires and entails, we will discuss both (the possibility of) “critique” and (the functioning of) “ideology”. In order to do so properly, we will explore related fields of theory and critique, such as ecocriticism and eco-/environmental feminism as well. Readings will include Val Plumwood, Timothy Morton, Yannis Stavrakakis, Bruno Latour and Slavoj Žižek. Test information The assessment includes a presentation, a midterm proposal and a final paper on (one of) the topics discussed in this course."},{"title":"Medical biotechnology towards clinical practice","description":"Medical biotechnology comprises the application of living cells or cell material in the development or generation of products to prevent, diagnose or treat human disease. Historical examples of biotechnology in support of medicine are the development of vaccines against smallpox and the production of antibiotics or human insulin by bacteria or yeast. Exciting 21st century developments are genetic engineering with CRISPR/Cas (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020), gene therapy, mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and stem cell-based regenerative medicine. Medical biotechnology is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field, integrating molecular, cell biological, genetic and immunological research areas. The first part of this Minor runs together with the course NWI-MOL104 Medical Biotechnology for students from the Faculty of Science and provides an overview of how interdisciplinary efforts help shaping modern healthcare by developing biotechnological diagnostics and therapeutics for precision medicine. Principles and concepts of medical biotechnology will be discussed in a scientific and medical context, including legal, societal and ethical considerations. Together with students from different life sciences disciplines you will write a medical biotechnological research proposal and present this at a mini-symposium. In the second half of the Minor you will carry out experiments in four different projects in the lab. These include molecular diagnostics (e.g., PCR, sequencing), recombinant DNA techniques, recombinant protein production, cell culture and adhesion assays, and cell transfection experiments mimicking gene therapy. Altogether, Medical Biotechnology towards Clinical Practice presents an excellent practical and theoretical course for students interested in molecular life sciences and in biotechnological innovations for patient care. Prerequisites: this is an advanced course in the broad field of Infectious Diseases. This course is only open for students from medicine, biomedical sciences or (human) biology. Period: Course is two full days per week (Thursday and Friday) September 2023-January 2024"},{"title":" History of Biology","description":"Aims At the end of this course, you are able to: 1. Recognise basic connections and tensions between biology and society through historic examples, in order to better appreciate such tensions in the current practice of biology. 2. Recognise and appreciate the variety of styles and organisation of research in research in reference to basic examples from the history of biology. 3. Recognise and understand the importance of social processes (such as fame, selective attention) for the development of research, at a basic level. 4. Understand how different approaches to history and current concerns affect how history is presented, based examples from the history of biology, at basic level. 5. Refer to the basic canon in the history of biology, including key names and crucial stories that are essential to the identity of a biologist (such as Darwin or Mendel). The history of biology is rich and full of remarkable stories, which are often surprisingly relevant for the present. For example, some theoretical puzzles and tensions in taxonomy that date back to the 18th century remain unresolved today. Similarly, there are exciting analyses of the problematic assumptions at the historic roots of evolutionary theory. History also offers us important warnings, such as for what can go wrong once totalitarian regimes determine what is good science and what is not. With the right perspective and the right kind of questions, the history of biology can offer instructive insights for fundamental theoretical problems, for the sometimes difficult relations between biology and society, and even offer a glimpse of half-forgotten knowledge. History also offers reflection on what is probably the toughest question of the discipline: what actually is biology? It may sound like a dreadful cliché, but the aim of this course is to learn from the past. The course will not present you with an endless stream of historic facts or isolated funny anecdotes (although some of the history of biology can be quite entertaining). The stress will be on the interpretation of history: we will try to understand patterns and relations in the development of biology, rather than list who discovered what, where, and when. To this end, the course is constructed around three main points: biology is diverse, biology is always connected to society, and biology has made mistakes from which we can learn a lot. For these purposes, the course will focus on the history of biology since the 18th century, where the most concrete connections with the current practice of biology can be made. With respect to diversity, the course will offer an overview of styles in doing biology, which will show that, historically, there were many different ways of doing biology. For example, whereas current biology is often dominated by laboratories and molecular biology, biology also has a rich heritage of a taxonomical style of research. In this style, the most important centres of biological research were museums of natural history, botanic gardens, and other collections of specimen that were carefully collected, often on long and adventurous expeditions to exotic places. We will see how the laboratory gained a foothold in biology towards the end of the 19th century and then gradually expanded its reign through the rise of genetics and later molecular biology. We will not only look at the development of biological ideas and research practices, but pay special attention to the development of the relation between biology and society. We will find out where biologists got their research funds in the past, how biological thinking incorporated ideas from wider culture, but also how biology had a profound societal impact itself. We will follow biologists around as they tried to improve agriculture, fought infectious diseases, or became activists calling for nature conservation and environmental protection. If we want to learn from history, then we should not only focus on the success stories and show cases, such as the discovery of the structure of DNA, or revered heroes such as Charles Darwin. We should also have the courage to see the dark side of biology’s history, such as the flirtations with eugenics or racism. For it is only when we have the courage to look in the dark corners that we may find the means to confront such monsters, should they once again rear their ugly heads. While the course does not require you to learn a lot of dates and names by heart, there is a basic list of names and stories any biologist should know, as part as your professional identity and frame of reference: the canon of biology. After all, how can you be a biologist and not know about Darwin, Mendel, or Watson&Crick. While any canon is somewhat aribitrary, this course too contains a list of essential names and stories in their historic setting. Test Assessment for the course consists of a computer exam (80% of the grade) with multiple choice and short open questions. The remaining 20% of the grade is based on answering at least five questions about the course material on joint bulletin boards. Strictly speaking, this is optional, but you need at least a 5 for the exam and a 5,5 overall grade to succeed."},{"title":"Biology and Society","description":"Aims – The different roles of biologists in society – The challenges and dilemmas that biologists face in these different roles – The basic principles of communication between dissenters Content The Biology and Society course focuses on the role of the biologist in society. Biologists are employed in a variety of roles in a variety of places. Think, for example, of biologists who work as policy makers for the government, as advisers for environmental organizations, as journalists, as teachers at schools or as researchers at knowledge institutions. For example, if farmers and conservationists cannot agree on how to deal with wild geese, biologists are asked to find out how many geese there are and what options exist for population management. And if an epidemic such as the Covid-19 pandemic breaks out, we ask doctors and medical biologists whether the vaccines are effective and whether it is wise to buy a large stock in the Netherlands, or when we can expect one in the future. As with all scientists, biologists do not operate in a vacuum. As a biologist you always work simultaneously in a scientific and a social environment. The Biology and Society course helps you to get to know the social environment and understand how it may work. This is done by looking at the relationship between biology and society in two ways, on the one hand from the perspective of ‘biology in society’ and on the other from the perspective of ‘society in biology. In the first perspective you should think of the numerous issues in society in which biology (and thus biological expertise) plays a role in one or the other way, such as the aforementioned issues with the wild geese and the threat of an epidemic, but also issues like ADHD, genetic screening, the increase in obesity, the use of laboratory animals in the lab, the so-called bio-based economy, global warming, the loss of biodiversity or the return of the wolf to the Netherlands. In many societal issues biologists are involved in many ways. The second perspective concerns the way in which society is present in and influences biological research practices and research agendas. For example, the government exerts influence on what is being researched by whom at a given time, for example in the form of the Netherlands Institute for Scientific Research (NWO), which funds a large part of scientific research in the Netherlands. But also to ethical committees, patient organizations, nature and environmental associations, concerned groups of citizens and/or individuals in society and, not to forget: the media have an impact on biological research. As a biologist, you have to deal with such societal actors to accomplish your goals. In this course we discuss different roles that you may adopt as a biologist in society and what you may encounter within this role in terms of societal issues. Test information Students are required to write a short essay (1500 – 2000 words) on a topical case of their choice, in which biologists play different societal roles. The aim of this essay is to examine the different ways in which biologists are involved in this topic, and to briefly discuss the specific possibilities and limitations of each role of biologists. For one of these roles, the student will more specifically identify which themes and related questions are at stake."},{"title":"Course Globalising Worlds / Human Geography","description":"This course focuses especially on global issues affecting the so-called Global South. This relates to issues such as climate change, trade, city planning, human mobility and transnational cooperation. In this course we seek to offer alternative approaches to interactions conceived as processes of globalisation by explicitly linking them to specific areas in the world, helping to thereby provide an integral analysis of place-space interconnectivities in globalisation processes. In this course we thereby also reveal how the spatial sciences have a key role to play in helping to literally and conceptually locate globalisation, to not only understand ‘why’ and ‘how’ but ‘why there’ it is grounded. The course will focus on societal changes arising out of local impacts of globalization. This, for instance, relates to particular forms of urban development (exploding cities, uneven cities, networked cities). Themes such as mobility, are explored in greater depth, with specific attention given to situations in the Global South. Key themes discussed in this course are: • On the move: globalization, capital mobility and human migration • Sustainability issues for a globalized world? Access to natural resources, globality of sustainable / wasteful societies • A global urban world: ‘planetary urbanism’, planning of growing mega-cities, the duality of formal/informal urban economies. Characteristics: Globalisation, sustainable development (including discussion of policy goals), local-global challenges, various domains linked to livelihoods in the global south, global south – north connections Period: September 2023-January 2024, level Ba 2, written exam"},{"title":"Course Borders and Identities in Europa / Human Geography","description":"In this course we will analyse the often implicit logic of the territoriality of the European integration process. In particular, after briefly discussing the historial construction of the European Union and the idea of Europe, we will study the continuous importance and impact of the social construction of internal national borders and the influence of populist nationalism in the European Union. And we will look at the financial, refugee and corona crisis which has led to new nationalism on the one hand and new federalism on the other. Then, we will analyse the ongoing cross-border collaboration between border regions at the internal borders of the European Union. Next, we will critically study the international migration at the external borders of the EU and the resulting externalisation policies. Lastly, we will study the possible futures of the European Union. After completing the course Borders and Identities in Europe the student is able to: • Understand the academic and social debate on the continuous (re)production of national borders and identities in and of the bordering of EUrope itself as well cross-border cooperation in the EU and with the near abroad outside the EU. • Critically analyse and discuss these developments of (re)production and actively participate in discussions on the topic Period: September 2023-January 2024, level Ba 2, written exam"},{"title":"Course Space and Environment in the European Union / Environment and Society Studies ","description":"The European Union (EU) exerts a strong influence on its member states. It constitutes a new politico-administrative layer above national states, affecting national policies, politics and polities in a wide range of areas, including environment and planning. At the same time, national governments retain a crucial role in European integration. National civil servants and politicians are deeply embedded in the development and adoption of EU policies, as well as in their implementation ‘back home’. Many people see the EU as highly complicated or even mind-boggling. ‘Brussels’ defies easy categorization in terms of its structure, governance process and operational logic. On top of this, it is under constant (re)construction. To further complicate things, the EU is facing a number of existential crises and challenges: BREXIT, the financial crisis and migration to name a few. The EU is regularly criticized by national media and politicians, and distrusted by the people – either for being ineffective and weak, or for being too dominant and imposing on the member states. These criticisms also relate to spatially relevant and environmental policies. In sum, the EU is important, complex, and heavily contested. For these reasons, it is imperative for students of planning and environmental policy to develop a deep understanding of processes of European integration and governance in those particular areas as well as more generally. The course ‘Space and environment in the EU’ (SEEU) will be given in close cooperation with the course ‘European Governance’ offered by the Department of Public Administration. The course is divided into four themes: (1) introduction and background, (2) government and administration, (3) the policy process, (4) implementation and Europeanisation. Knowledge and insights specific to the fields of spatially relevant and environmental policies will be further developed in a number of lectures and working groups. Aims After finishing the course Space & Environment in the European Union the student is able to: • Understand and explain the processes of EU policy-making and decision-making as well as the effects of spatially-relevant and environmental policies in the EU member states and regions; • Understand and explain, from a theoretical perspective, the processes and outcomes of a Europeanisation of spatial and environmental policy arrangements and planning systems; • Reflect on the governance arrangements, policy objectives and spatial and environmental impacts of EU policies, and to discuss the different channels of influence through which these policies achieve their objectives; • Apply the most important concepts, developments and policies of the EU in the field of environment and planning to specific issues of spatial and/or environmental relevance.

Due to globalization, migration and international work mobility, intercultural contact between people from different cultures -and different language backgrounds- has become more common in recent decades. Societies have become increasingly multicultural. Intercultural communication is a part of life for most people, in both everyday and work contexts. For business professionals who work in an international setting, or for students studying abroad, it is important to have insight into the ways in which culture can play a role in intercultural contact situations, in terms of behaviour in general and interpersonal communication in particular. This course considers the concept of culture, and how culture influences our thinking, acting and being. It examines the influence of culture on verbal and non-verbal communication, the relationship between culture, identity and communication, and how cultural value orientations influence our worldview and the way we behave towards others. The course also considers topics such as acculturation in immigrants and expats, culture shock, and the development of intercultural (communication) competence. At the end of the course, students will: • Be able to identify and describe fundamental theoretical concepts and principles that are relevant to understanding communication between people from different cultural and social backgrounds; • Have insight into the concept of culture, cultural differences and how culture can influence verbal and non-verbal behaviour; • Have insight into contributors to – and issues in – intercultural communication today, and be able to reflect critically on these; • Have insight into acculturation/cultural adaptation, culture shock, and the development of intercultural (communication) competence, and be able to identify and critically reflect on factors that play a role in these processes English level B2 is necessary, Ba 1 course"},{"title":"Extra module Radboud honours academy","description":"In this module, students join the general introduction for international students at our university.

The course will start outlining what Psychology is about: which questions does it want to answer and how does it do so? During the course we will cover multiple subdisciplines such as biological, social, developmental and clinical psychology. Topics that will be discussed include memory, consciousness, perception, emotion, personality and psychological disorders and their treatment. In addition, you will become acquainted with various research methods used in the field of psychology. Additionally, you will gain insight into the advantages and disadvantages of various research methods used to answer research questions in the social sciences. Next to teaching you about psychology, the course also encourages you to reflect on your future professional career. Besides the above-mentioned curriculum there will be weekly exercises to guide this reflection process. You will learn not only to question your own assumptions but also help others questions theirs by providing constructive feedback and discussion. If we want to improve our knowledge, we consult media. Whether we refer to social media, documentaries, or newspapers, all of these media carry meanings about the world. Even if we turn to media for entertainment they will provide us with images of the world around us. Media content is built on representations. As is science. Science, more specific scientific papers, offer access to (a specific part of) reality by creating representations of reality based on scientific methods and rules. The scope of this part of the module concerns media content. How do we know the world? What are the most important systems of representations that shape media content (images, language, narrative, rhetoric)? In communication science content analysis is a distinctive method. However, different theories create different perspectives on ‘content’ and therefore will read content differently. At the end of the module you will have an overview over the discipline of psychology and research methods in the social sciences. In addition, you are invited to act as a participant in research projects of other students to increase your understanding of the participants point of view and to be introduced to a wide variety of labs and research approaches. At the end of this module: • You’ll be able to distinguish different perspectives on media content. • You’ll be able to describe the relationship between ‘reality’ and its symbolic ‘representation’. • You’ll be able to identify and apply different signs and sign systems that shape media reality, in the analysis of media content. This minor entails the following learning objectives: • You’ll have an understanding of the field of psychology and its subdisciplines. • You’ll have insight into how different factors can influence human thinking, feeling and behavior. • You’ll understand how the empirical cycle is used to answer questions about human behaviour. • You’ll able to identify advantages and disadvantages of various research methods used to answer psychological research questions. • You’ll be able to assess the relevance of research articles (scientific and popular-scientific) and formulate critical questions about them. • You’ll develop personal skills for giving and receiving feedback in a professional and constructive manner, both verbally and written. • You’ll be able to critically reflect on your development as an academic professional and you can communicate your perspective verbally and written. • You’ll be able to distinguish different perspectives on media content. • You’ll be able to describe the relationship between ‘reality’ and its symbolic ‘representation’. • You’ll be able to identify and apply different signs and sign systems that shape media reality, in the analysis of media content.

Multiple-choice exam with a minimum passing grade 5.5 out of 10 Period: August 2023 – January 2024."},{"title":"Module Religious Contacts and Conflicts ","description":"The Radboud Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies offers three modules for IISMA students. The modules comprise three courses in the Philosophy, Politics and Society bachelor programme. You can only take a course (5 ECTS) if you also take the two associated courses during the same semester. An entire module will be 15 ECTS. In order to secure a diverse population at max three Iisma students can be allowed for a module. Three courses: The Silk Road: Religious Cultures, Conflicts and Contacts from Europe to China You will both deepen and broaden your knowledge of the religions and cultures that have developed along the ‘Silk Road’. You’ll develop insight into the most signficant interactions between Asia and the West. The Silk Road, which ran between Europe and China, was not just a trade route, but also a conduit for the distribution of ideas and religions from East to West and vice versa. By focusing on the ancient Silk Road, this course highlights the important role this area played in the formation and spread of religious cultures. The course introduces the world’s major religions, it familiarizes students with the basic tenets of each tradition, and looks at a number of specific instances of interaction between religions and cultures in this region. Test: Written Exam State and Diversity: Politics and the Role of Religion in North-Africa and the Middle-East After completing this course, you will be to understand: • political developments in the Middle east and North Africa in the modern and contemporary periods; • economic evolutions in the Middle East and North Africa after the colonial era; • role of religious movements and activism in the Middle East-North Africa region; • difficulties and opportunities to generate rule of law, modern citizenship, and democratic systems in the MENA region; • local, national and regional political and mobilizations in the MENA region; • cultural, demographic, and anthropological changes in the MENA region in the last several decades. State and Diversity is a crash course in Middle Eastern politics and the special role Islam plays in the political process. In twelve classes it deals with the most important topics and debates among political scientists working on the region. Topics to be analyzed include the social structure of societies in the region, the role of the authoritarian states, the “oil curse” and the rentier state, the way political parties function, the limitations of civil society, the position of women, and the permeability of the region and the interference of foreign powers. Special attention will be given to the role Islamic movements play in the region and the so-called “sectarianization” of political conflicts. The central question is why the Arab Spring (2010-2011) happened and why the dominant political theories failed to predict these uprisings. In addition, we will discuss possible future developments in the region. Test information The examination is based on the writing of essays Dying for God: Martyrdom, Terrorism and Religious Violence In addition to becoming familiar with narratives of violence and suffering related to the three religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), a significant goal of the course is to understand how the concept of “religious violence” functions in a broader discourse of religion, politics, and society. By the end of the course, therefore, you will be able to: • identify and describe a wide range of primary texts produced by Jews, Christians, and Muslims from antiquity through today that comprise stories of martyrdom and violence; • discuss in a critical manner why the terms “martyrdom”, “terrorism”, and “religious violence” are more than simple, descriptive labels; • understand how the concept of “religious violence” functions in a broader discourse of religion, politics, and society; • summarize how different religious traditions, political groups, and modern audiences have employed stories about dying/killing for God in their respective historical contexts; • evaluate and explain the various uses of these texts in contemporary discourse, especially political, social, and ethical discussions; • clearly and effectively respond to the course materials, both orally in the context of class discussion, and in written form. What makes a martyr? What makes a terrorist? How and why would an individual be willing to die and/or kill for God? These are some of the questions this course explores as we consider how martyrdom, terrorism, and violence (more broadly defined) are significant concepts in the discourse of religious identity, from antiquity until today. During the course students will read and discuss several ancient, medieval, and modern narratives of violence and self-sacrifice in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic contexts. In analyzing these texts we will not only consider what function their tellings (and retellings) may have for their respective religious communities, but we will also question why such accounts of violence are considered so striking. Why are certain actors defined as “martyr” and others as “terrorist”, who is doing the labeling, and for what purpose. What are the ideological or political motivations for such designations, and what kinds of conflicts arise when communities compete over them? Thus, a major goal of this course is to uncover and describe why religious communities, political groups, and/or scholars of religion are invested in making such identifications. This course will consider the intersection of religion and violence in stories about dying and killing for God, and the impact of these images on political and social discourse in both historical and contemporary contexts.

The course will cover both theoretical and empirical contributions and will often refer to current policy issues in both international trade and macroeconomics. Using theoretical and empirical tools, we will consider a wide range of questions such as: what are the gains of specialization? what is the effect of trade on inequality? How does market power of firms affect international trade? What are the consequences of trade policies? How to understand international financial flows? What is the relation between exchange rates and monetary policy? How does globalization affect the conduct of macroeconomic policies? Is the euro an optimal currency area? Why so many international financial crises?."},{"title":"MICROECONOMICS: INFORMATION, DESIGN AND INSTITUTIONS","description":"This course studies the design of institutions that optimally cope with fundamental, longstanding economic questions (allocation of private goods, public good provision, externalities). We start from a simple, institution-free description of each question, try to understand the basic tensions at work, and derive institutions that optimally address these tensions. In the process, we introduce the important ideas of social choice, game theory, and market design. We will shed light on the theoretical concepts using empirical applications and in class games. The course is divided into four parts: 1. Social Choice, Efficiency and Welfare: We discuss normative criteria to evaluate collective choices made by a society comprised of individuals with possibly conflicting preferences (e.g. unanimity, not ruling out any preferences, not being dictatorial), and show that it is impossible to create institutions leading to choices that always satisfy even a minimal list of criteria. Next we introduce the possibility of pecuniary transfers to compensate individuals for social choices that harm them. We show that, when they are acceptable, Pareto efficiency and utilitarianism are equivalent, and a natural notion of social welfare emerges that ranks possible social choices. 2. Game Theory and Incentives: With this natural notion of optimal social choices, the question becomes a positive one: how can such choices be implemented. The difficulty is that the social value of different choices can only be assessed from the preferences of individuals. But each individual is the only one to know her true preferences, and must therefore be incentivized to provide this information. Institutions can be understood as rules of a game in which individuals strategically report their preferences. Game theory is the science of such strategic interactions, and we will introduce its basic ideas and some applications (e.g. competition between firms, tax fraud, bitcoin, pollution abatement). 3. Institutions as Mechanisms: At this stage, we are equipped to look for institutions that lead to efficient social choices in spite of asymmetric information about preferences. We will do so for three types of important economic problems: the allocation of private goods, the provision of public goods, and the organization of trade. We show that well designed auctions can solve the allocation problem. Using this as a starting point, we derive a general class of mechanisms that solve the incentive problem and lead to efficient social choices. They do so by using transfers that lead individuals to internalize the externality they exercise on others, and therefore align their incentives with social welfare. Such mechanisms however lead to budget deficits when applied to public good provision or trade. In fact, we show that efficiency cannot be achieved for these problems and we derive second-best solutions, that is, institutions that are optimal given the need to incentivize individuals. As the number of agents increases, we show that the inefficiency disappears, and that these second-best solutions come to resemble the ideal situation of perfectly competitive markets, thus providing support for the idea of market efficiency. For the public good problem, however, scaling if of no use. 4. Limits to Efficiency: In the last part of the course, we examine other possible sources of economic inefficiency. We start by looking at monopolies and their pricing strategies. We explain first, second and third-degree price discrimination. We explain how second degree-price discrimination can be understood as a mechanism designed to maximize profit rather than welfare. We also show how online information about consumers affects third-degree price discrimination, and use this to discuss the regulation of online data. Then we show how asymmetric information can destroy efficient trade even in competitive markets when they are subject to adverse selection and apply this idea to financial markets, job markets and insurance markets. Finally, we go back to auctions and the private good allocation problem, and show that a revenue-maximizing seller will optimally design auctions that distort efficiency."},{"title":"MAJOR FIELDS OF INVESTIGATION IN SOCIOLOGY","description":"The course focuses on sociological concepts and methods through the lens of the city. We will apply sociological concepts to the city that we can see when we walk around, the city of buildings and people; and also to the city that we don’t notice – the city of sentiments, conflict, traffic flows, bike messengers, sewage networks, asset prices and municipal taxation, of animals and nature. This course uses key sociological readings, case studies, and in-the-news topics, to study the city as a complex space where buildings, people, animals, laws, policies, and international financial flows, intersect to produce our lived experience. The aim is for us to be able to see sociological concepts even as we walk around in the city. In this course you will learn the key strategies and skills of academic writing – how to write an effective academic research paper based on a city of your choice. A key learning objective is close reading of texts, understanding the key argument of each text, and applying concepts to the real world. The first four weeks explore foundational texts while the rest of the weeks address specific questions related to housing markets, social policy, violence, drugs, environmental change, segregation, urban infrastructure, urban regulations, and so on."},{"title":"LITERATURE AND THE LAW : READING AND WRITING ABOUT RIGHTS IN WESTERN CULTURE","description":"In this course, we will explore the ongoing negotiation of rights and responsibilities in the modern Western world as represented in both fiction and non-fiction works.

The course will be organized thematically with respect to the chronological progression and will be based on a critical intersectional and decolonial approach, which presupposes a reevaluation of the history of feminism organized around the wave metaphor and centered on white middle-class feminisms in Europe and North America. Throughout the course, we will conduct a decentralized analysis of world feminisms in various local, national, and transnational contexts, such as in colonial and decolonial settings, within the international socialist movement and transnational women’s networks during the Cold War, under dictatorships in Latin America and in post-World War II Asia, etc. Each session will be organized around the discussion of a secondary source (scientific article, book chapter) and the analysis of a primary source (historical document, such as an excerpt of a speech, photo, video, etc.)."},{"title":"INTRODUCTION TO CLIMATE DIPLOMACY","description":"This class is aimed at students willing to understand the dynamics of international politics in the fight against climate change. The class will be oriented towards the study of the main issues of this multifaceted diplomacy, in constant redefinition, in interaction with many fields of conventional diplomacy.

Based on the teacher’s experience of current events and means of climate diplomacy, the course will be based on a thematic approach, enriched by notions of political science."},{"title":"GOVERNING BORDERS IN THE 21ST CENTURY","description":"This course offers an introduction to the study of migration, borders and security in the 21st Century. We will explore how the governance of migration and borders has been transformed to include a diverse range of actors away from the exclusive domain of the state. Increasingly, EU agencies, IGOs, NGOs, security professionals and religious organisations have become key players in governing mobilities. Key rationalities underpinning this governance will be explored, from managerial, to security, and humanitarian. Emerging practices for migration control often defy a territorial logic to borders, instead taking place in so-called transit and sending countries or in virtual spaces through surveillance and technology mechanisms. Thus, far from disappearing, as some scholars of globalization maintain, borders are emerging in new spaces both inside and outside the territorial state. This leads us to question the location of borders, their constitution, and their effects on liberties and fundamental rights. The course will provide students with the knowledge and concepts to think critically about how power works through borders and with what effects on states, populations and individuals in terms of their inclusion/exclusion, freedom, and mobility."},{"title":"AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND GLOBALIZATION","description":"With the war in Ukraine, the Covid crisis, soaring agricultural prices and global warming, the issues of food security, food sovereignty and sustainability are more important than ever.

It presents the role of international institutions and agreements in the regulation of agricultural trade and discusses recent events affecting the world food system."},{"title":"BEHAVIORAL GAME THEORY","description":"Game theory is a formal language to describe situations in which each agent’s decision affects other agents’ well-being. Games can be used to analyze a very broad range of economic, social and political interactions. The main objective of the class is to present all key concepts of game theory (players, strategies, solution concepts etc..), and apply them. The course is self-contained and does not require any previous knowledge in game theory. The class also incorporates behavioral considerations that help better understand what agents actually do or should do. The methodology of controlled experiments in economics is presented, and recent experiments discussed."},{"title":"COMPARATIVE POLITICS","description":"What is Comparative Politics? How do we analyse politics comparatively? How can we make sense of the variation in the ways that political institutions and political authority are organised in contemporary societies? What are the effects of these multiple and different ways of organising politics? How do the main actors, institutions and processes that structure politics change across social and cultural settings? Finally, how does a comparative approach help us understand the contemporary world of politics? This course builds on the key concepts, theories and approaches introduced in the first-year course Introduction to Political Science by providing a more in-depth examination of the key elements that structure contemporary politics. It will focus, primarily, on established (mainly western) democracies but will systematically introduce comparative elements with political systems in all regions of the world (Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East) to provide students with a wider and global perspective of politics and of political analysis. The course will allow students to acquire the analytical tools to understand and examine politics comparatively and to reflect about it in a sophisticated manner. It will do so by providing students with an overview of the epistemological and methodological issues that are central to the definition of Comparative Politics, as well as of the various approaches that shape our understanding of this field of study within Political Science. The course will stimulate the development of a sophisticated understanding of politics by focusing on several key overaching themes in the study of Comparative Politics, as well as on a comprehensive overview of contemporary comparative analyses of political institutions, actors and processes. The 48 hours of lectures and seminars that form this core course in the Major in Politics and Government have been designed to offer students a coherent approach in their learning by combining and complementing the lecture materials with the readings and practical cases that will be discussed in the seminar sessions. Both components (lectures and seminars) are an integral part of the course, and experience indicates that only students that attend both the lectures and the seminars are likely to achieve good grades in the course. This entails actively engaging with the lectures and seminars, as well as carefully preparing the readings assigned for both the lectures and the seminars."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2023":{"RA":{"amount":71,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.48,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":101,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":90,"upperBound":155}},"RW":{"amount":5,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.81,"upperBound":3.98},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":150}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/60-universitat-pompeu-fabra/","name":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra","location":"Barcelona, Spain","academicPeriod":{"start":"September 26, 2023","end":"December 13, 2023"},"language":{"ielts":6,"toefl":80,"det":115},"courses":[{"title":"Cinematic Creativity in Spain: Authorship, Industry, Politics ","description":"The course explores the notions of creativity and authorship through historic and contemporary examples from Spanish cinematography, focusing on their aesthetic, industrial and political dimension.

No doubt that fact had a positive impact on the ethics and integrity of sports governance. But the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly changed the world of sport. The economic importance of sport and its cross-border nature puts sports institutions before an uncertain future. This course aims to present and discuss five key challenges for the future of global sports governance, namely: i) the autonomy of Sport Government Bodies (SGB) to rule the world of sports and their legitimacy to ask for compliance to the athletes and other political actors and states. The Ethics and Law of the Good Governance of Sport ii) the arising of a new legal order in sport’s domain. That is the so-called Lex Sportiva whose content and scope as a new Jurisprudence in sports will be discussed. Towards a new Jurisprudence of Sport iii) the evolution and changes experienced by the concept of equality in sport and its implications regarding gender issues (trans, neutral gender and intersex athletes) as well as high-tech ones (cyborgs, robots) pose to the future of sports. What does equality mean in Sport? iv) the impact of AI and high tech in sport governance, particularly on the ethics of sports and athletes’ rights. The ethics of AI in Sport. v) the sustainability of mega-sport events in times of climate emergency. The future of Sport. These five challenges are linked.

The objective of this course is to analyze the main problems related to gender, sexuality, the body, and diversity in the context of an increasingly globalized planet. With “Past and Present,” we refer to two fundamental aspects in which the course will deepen: 1) the legitimation of stereotypes and issues related to gender, sexuality, the body and diversity through the un-critical projection of the current logics to the past; and 2) the incorporation of historical trajectories and perspectives in order to understand in all their complexity the mechanisms that originated and perpetuate the problems covered in the course."},{"title":"Mind, Brains and Machines","description":"This course centers on the interaction between Neurosciences, Engineering and the Humanities, by posing crucial questions on intelligence, perception and aesthetics. How brains and machines build up knowledge? What is intelligence and “what do we talk about when we talk about artificial intelligence”? We will analyze how sensory systems build up a representation of the world, with particular attention to vision and audition. In parallel, we will explore the minimal requirements of a brain, building on our age-old attempts to build artificial intelligent systems. We will review the history of artificial intelligence and brain science, focusing on the connections that the two fields have had, on and off, over the years.

This module aims to: Help students understand how wider social, intellectual and cultural movements have impacted upon medicine, neuroscience and psychiatry, provide opportunities for students to critically explore the development of psychiatry and mental health, contrasting perspectives from science, the arts and humanities, facilitate students in understanding the limitations of a purely neuroscientific conception of mental health and psychopathology."},{"title":"Multilingualism and Sustainable Development","description":"This module is intended to engage students in the debate on the absence of any reference to languages in the SDGs by considering the centrality of languages to access rights, in particular in terms of equality, diversity, and inclusion."},{"title":"Global Connections: A Transdisciplinary Approach","description":"Globalisation has changed our perspectives and experiences of the world through multidimensional, fluid and complex processes that interlink cultural, economic, ideological, political, social and environmental factors. In our increasingly interconnected world, the importance of developing, promoting and enhancing our intercultural awareness and understanding of global connections shouldn’t be underestimated. In the wake of counter-globalisation forces and the rise of the national populist movement, a rich and pluralistic appreciation and understanding of ‘the global’ will be relevant to all Warwick graduates in their personal and professional lives. ‘Global Connections’ offers a transdisciplinary approach to learning through an innovative and research-led discussion format which encourages students to share insights as co-collaborators. Workshops, multidisciplinary peer group work, and practical activities guide the learning experience, and are facilitated by specialists from a range of subject areas who are engaged in globally-oriented projects. Students are encouraged to integrate their own disciplinary knowledge, personal experiences, and reflections as they examine the complexities of global connections throughout the module."},{"title":"Local/Global Shakespearience","description":"Have you ever been Shakespearienced? The likely answer is yes. If you’ve ever watched The Lion King or Black Panther, or listened to Taylor Swift or Radiohead, then you’ve experienced Shakespeare. The playwright’s characters, language and plot are woven into the fabric of modern popular culture and, since he set quill to parchment in sixteenth-century England, his stories have travelled across the world, impacting on the lives of countless communities and individuals. This impact is felt on both global and local levels and, on this module, you will have the opportunity to engage with key artists who adapt Shakespeare within such local and global contexts, including climate activists, film-makers, graphic novelists, podcasters and rappers. You will interrogate how Shakespeare, as a global playwright, can be indigenised and used as a platform for community identity and as a tool to explore contemporary issues of politics, race, class, gender and culture. You will also be invited to explore notions of ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture and the impact of technological innovation on the development of interdisciplinary performance forms. The dissemination of performance across cultures and technologies will be a key consideration of the module and, as a result, you will work in real time on a group practical project, create your own podcast episode and share the development of creative materials."},{"title":"Censorship and Society","description":"Censorship and Society explores the breadth and diversity of censorship across a range of disciplines, countries, time periods, and cultures. We will engage in debates exploring the controversy surrounding censorship, and how this has continued to grow in intensity. The module will inspire discussions on why literature is banned or censored. Is censorship ever justified or realisable? Does censorship inhibit and impose a dictatorship? Who defines the moral values that govern society? How do standards of morality and immorality, obscenity and non-obscenity, differ widely from culture to culture? Can a system of censorship be established which will protect the moral values of a community without infringing upon freedom of expression? Can we ever obtain freedom of expression? These discussions will facilitate your analysis and understanding of the reading."},{"title":"Inequalities and Sustainable Development: Inclusion and Dignity for All","description":"This module allows students to focus in-depth on the concept of inequalities.

Following the course we aim to equip students to address these challenges."},{"title":"The Energy Trilemma","description":"Global energy markets are in a period of dramatic transition. The emergence of shale gas, mostly notably in the US, has been disruptive to the industry, leading to falling oil prices. This has challenged the long-time dominant position of international oil companies (e.g. BP, Shell, ExxonMobil) in the petroleum sector. Natural gas has emerged as a potentially important ‘bridging fuel’ to a low carbon future, with several leading national economiesincluding China, making the switch from carbon-intensive oil and coal to this ‘lower-carbon’ alternative. Away from oil and gas, renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost competitive and are gaining societal and governmental support. The energy transition alters the global dynamics of energy security, with some countries finding their energy independence challenged, whilst others enjoy the economic growth that is inherently linked to energy abundance. A similar distinction can be made between populations with regards to energy equity: the accessibility and affordability of energy, and as with energy security this too is in a state of flux due to changing market conditions. These three dimensions: sustainability, energy security and energy equity constitute an ‘energy trilemma’; the focus of this module. The module addresses the challenges posed by the trilemma to national, regional and local economies, and in developing, emerging and developed economic contexts. In addition to the trilemma’s aforementioned dimensions, the module will also consider concerns of energy efficiency, ‘green growth’, sustainable energy governance and cooperation, and technology and infrastructure. In this regard, the module will broaden the student’s knowledge and understanding of the key issues around the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 7."},{"title":"Health and Sustainable Development","description":"This module offers an in-depth examination of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (good health and well-being) and the broader field of global health.

Urban areas are expected to absorb virtually all future population growth (UN 2018) and by 2030 are projected to accommodate 60% of the global population: one-third of which will live in cities with at least half a million inhabitants (UN 2018). Despite covering only 2% of the world’s landmass, cities produce 70% of total carbon emissions, over half of the world’s GDP, are locations of often stark inequality and are uniquely vulnerable to a changing climate, as a result of their concentrated population and infrastructure. Cities are spaces of social and technological innovation, but also some of the most pressing human welfare concerns. Thus understanding the urban context is critical in promoting more sustainable trajectories of human development."},{"title":"Public Engagement","description":"Public engagement is about connecting the work of universities with wider society.

Weekly tutorials will also be provided to allow for further detailed, personal critique and ongoing development of an individual student’s creative writing and practice. Students will also work as part of an editorial team, alongside the module tutor, to produce a group publication, with each student taking on and learning about specific roles in the editorial and publishing processes. This will result in a group publication featuring creative writing work by all group members. Please note places on BASC0007 are limited and interested students must submit a small portfolio of creative writing to be considered. Please email uasc-ug-office@ucl.ac.uk for details of the portfolio requirements.

It explores the social and cultural forces that have given rise to changing views of the city over time, as well as the diversity of ‘Londons’ that may arise within a single time period. Through analysis of a wide range of films, the module investigates how the city has been imagined, and what meanings it has embodied, in a wide variety of genres and time periods. Students develop skills necessary to deconstruct, decode, and interpret filmic imagery, sound, dialogue, and story, and demonstrate how their knowledge and understanding of London’s history in the twentieth century can be applied to film analysis with reference to both textual and contextual factors."},{"title":"Historical Geographies of Medicine: From Imperial Hygiene to Global Health","description":"This module explores the relationship between medicine and projects of European imperial expansion. Focusing on the period 1750 to the present, the module examines how European encounters with unfamiliar bodies, places, and diseases led to changes in the practice of medicine as public health increasingly became a ‘tool of empire’. Informed by scholarship from medical and environmental history, students learn how a geographical perspective can be used to interrogate the histories and contemporary legacies of these encounters with difference. Key topics that will be considered include: disease and environment; the emergence of racial medicine; sexuality and gender; and the colonial legacies of contemporary global health."},{"title":"Unravelling Britain: British History since 1801","description":"Over the last two centuries, Britain has changed beyond recognition. From the industrial revolution to the sexual revolution, new forces have transformed the lives of ordinary men and women. The rise and fall of the British Empire, a series of global wars and migration to and from Britain challenged what it meant to be British, while political institutions became increasingly democratic. In the sciences, the theory of evolution, the invention of television and the coming of the atom bomb offered exciting and sometimes terrifying possibilities, with far-reaching effects on British society. New forms of leisure emerged, while attitudes towards homosexuality, race, religion and the rights of women have been redrawn. This module provides a rich introduction to modern British history, from 1801 to the present day. If you have not previously studied the period, it will give you the foundation for specialist modules in subsequent years. If you have some prior knowledge, it will challenge you with new interpretations from the cutting edge of historical research. The module introduces you to new critical approaches to the subject and draws extensively on primary sources such as film, pop music and visual imagery. It has a strong global dimension, showing how crises in India, Asia and Africa shaped the ‘British World’. By the end of the module, you will have developed new skills in source analysis while challenging your preconceptions about modern Britain. Above all, we hope to enthuse you with the richness and diversity of British history, and the possibilities it offers for further study."},{"title":"London: Walking the City","description":"The movement and flow that might produce “city” is the movement of people; the proposition of highways and alleyways, green spaces and social housing; the configuration and scheduling of transport; the regulation and timetabled glow of light; the whiffs and breezes and pockets of air pollution. It is also the circulation of ideas and the pulse of affect. From the Rock Against Racism festival in 1978 in Victoria Park to the 1920s West End of the female flaneuse; from the site of riotous Bartholomew Fair in early modern Farringdon to the Victorian East End music hall to the Roman city that lingers in the strata of the present city’s infrastructure, this module curates a series of weekly encounters with the literary and performative city. Students will walk London, and travel along its transport connections, listening to guides, looking around them and engaging self-reflexively with the meanings and imperatives found in the ¿city”. The module will include walking lectures, seminars and workshops and will develop skills of close reading, observation, critical thinking and effective communication."},{"title":"British Horror: Film, Television and Literature","description":"British cinema is often celebrated for its social realism, yet it has made significant and influential contributions to the worlds of horror, fantasy and science fiction. From the Gothic tradition of Dracula to the nightmarish vision of London in 28 Days Later, this module investigates this alternative history or ‘repressed underside’ of British cinema and the ways in which these films have responded to their social and cultural production contexts. Introducing you to a range of critical approaches to film, this module will explore debates on the cultural appeal and social significance of horror, the meaning of horror figures like the vampire, werewolf and zombie, and the nature of audiences and film spectatorship. Key discussion topics will be the representation of gender and sexuality in horror texts; the psychoanalytic interpretation of horror; and the ways in which the films respond to the history of Britain and its capital. With an emphasis on cinema, we will also compare the writing of British authors with film adaptations of their work."},{"title":"Consumer Psychology","description":"A deep understanding consumers is critical for businesses that wish to meet and satisfy consumer needs. The module will help students to gain an in-depth understanding of what makes consumers buy some products and not others, how various psychological characteristics influence our consumer behaviours, how companies can best try to meet consumers’ wants and needs, among other interesting topics. Building on a general understanding of marketing, this course develops a useful, conceptual understanding of psychological theories relevant to the study of consumer behaviour."},{"title":"Witches, Demons and Magic in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe","description":"The central theme of this module is the ‘supernatural’ in the early modern world. The module will explore beliefs in witches, demons and magic, and phenomena such as angels, ghosts, dreams and miracles using case studies from a range of European countries across the period 1450 – 1750. It will investigate the interplay between popular and elite ideas about witchcraft and magic and how these changed over the course of the period. Topics will include: witchcraft, sabbats, the diabolic pact and black magic; witch trials, torture and execution; demonic possession and exorcism; angels, ghosts and fairies; and monsters and miracles. Students will be given the opportunity to discuss a range of textual and visual primary sources including woodcuts, witchcraft trials, popular pamphlets and official treatises (all in translation). Students will model a holistic approach to the study of the ‘supernatural’ in the early modern world, and reflect on the meanings that witchcraft and the supernatural continue to hold in the modern world."},{"title":"The Buildings of London I: From the Ashes of Fire to the Capital of Empire","description":"Taught by numerous site visits to historic buildings alongside lectures and seminars, this course introduces students to the study of architecture by exploring buildings in the London area from the start of the seventeenth century to the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. During the course, we will witness London burn to the ground, be comprehensively rebuilt, and then expand from a small European capital into the largest city in the world. Along the way, we will encounter a wide variety of buildings including cathedrals, palaces, churches, synagogues, breweries, shops, and hospitals. Students will acquire skills in looking at, reading, and understanding buildings and become adept at using them as historical evidence. Students will also learn how to relate architecture to its social, political, and intellectual context, and develop insights into the ways that buildings may carry and convey meaning, whether to an expert or to a more general audience. No prior knowledge of architecture or architectural history is required to undertake the course."},{"title":"Fundamentals of Management","description":"This module introduces students to the purpose, operations and implications of management by exploring the contexts within which management takes place. We reflect on management in relation to the social, economic, technological and legal conditions within which it operates, and analyse political and environmental consequences. We often think of management as trying to manage flows of energy, finance and labour, but it increasingly is required to confront changing social and political structures on a world scale, and challenging environmental conditions as well."},{"title":"British Politics","description":"This module offers an intermediate-level grounding in contemporary British politics and government. Students will learn about the UK’s political constitution, sovereign parliament, electoral politics, public debate, cabinet government, civil service and devolved and local administrations. They will develop a breadth and depth of knowledge, and a range of capabilities, that will prepare them to pursue careers in Westminster, Whitehall and beyond."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":26,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.04,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":103,"upperBound":110},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":100,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":4,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.67,"upperBound":3.82},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":13,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.25,"upperBound":3.86},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":8,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.25,"upperBound":3.86},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/39-lancaster-university/","name":"Lancaster University","location":"United Kingdom","academicPeriod":{"start":"October 02, 2023","end":"December 15, 2023"},"language":{"ielts":6.5,"toefl":87},"courses":[{"title":"Global Families and Intimacy","description":"Family and intimate relationships form a crucial part of everyday social life. We are born into family and intimate relationships. We establish, maintain and dissolve family and intimate bonds over the life course. We navigate our changing relationship with parents, siblings, and relatives. We establish, maintain and re-establish intimate ties with partners and perhaps children. But what are ‘families’? What makes intimate relationships ‘intimate’? How do people date, marry, separate, divorce, and re-partner? How do people ‘do’ families and intimacy in the everyday vicissitudes of match-making, romance, conflicts, care, money, domestic labour, and power? Why do people practise families and intimacy as they do? How do broader social, economic, political and cultural institutions configure our ‘private’ lives? How do the ways in which we relate to family members and intimate others shape the societies in which we live? In an increasingly interconnected world, family and intimate relationships — personal and private as they are — are increasingly shaped by social forces operating on a global scale. The changing forms and practices of families and intimacy also help shape social trends as grandeur as globalisation. In this module, we explore theoretical and empirical issues pertaining to the resilience and transformation of family and intimate relationships in a global context."},{"title":"Women Film Makers","description":"The module will explore the work of some of the most historically important female film-makers from the 1890s through to the present, considering films from around the globe. The module will examine the significant but often marginalized and obscured roles that women have played in industrial, experimental and avant-garde film production across a spectrum of roles from costume and production designers through to screen-writers, editors and directors. You will be invited to reflect upon the fact that, despite playing key roles in the development of the medium, women continue to be excluded at all levels of film production. The module will engage with revisionist film histories concerned with interrogating the dominant bias of academic and popular histories of the medium; it will also draw on feminist film theory concerned both with a critical understanding of mainstream cinema and the development of politicized women’s cinemas. The module will examine a series of key female directors and their work, and each week will be oriented around the screening of a case study film that will be the focus for the seminar."},{"title":"Project Management Tools & Techniques","description":"This course aims to introduce project management methods in a way which links to the life cycle of a typical project from the early project identification and definition stages, through project execution and control, to issues of implementation and change. The coverage of the early stages of the project cycle uses methods emerging from the systems movement and stresses the strategic relevance of project management. The operational management of the project is covered by introducing techniques for the planning, scheduling and controlling of projects. Attention is also given to people management aspects of this process especially to leadership, team working, motivation and direction."},{"title":"Transformations: From Mass Media to Social Media","description":"In this module, you will consider competing definitions of the terms ‘culture’ and ‘media’, engage with a wide range of academic writings on culture and media, and analyse a diverse range of cultural material from different media including: television, films, photography, newspapers and magazines, video games and the world wide web. You will explore the ways in which our identities, aspirations, beliefs and value systems are shaped by the cultural environment in which we live."},{"title":"Entrepreneurship: Discovery and Practice","description":"The module will develop an introductory understanding of entrepreneurship as well as introducing you to experience a range of entrepreneurial skills (creativity, accessing resources, building networks and creating value) to enable to you understand key aspects of the entrepreneurial process. These skills will be transferable to many contexts, whether you wish to open your own business, be entrepreneurial in your career, or for working within Government or social enterprises."},{"title":"Hollywood and beyond: Global cinema","description":"This core module is designed to further develop your analytical skills in order to examine individual films in close detail and to encourage you to understand global cinema in a variety of social, cultural, political and industrial contexts. The module will explore such issues as the relationship between film form and modes of production, theories of film style and aesthetics, the political function of cinema. In the first term, we focus wholly on various modes of American film production and in the second term we explore some broader theoretical questions through an analysis of films from a number of different national traditions. Across the whole module you will gain a thorough grasp not only of the historical factors shaping various national cinemas, but also of some key critical and theoretical concepts within the field of film studies."},{"title":"Introduction to Business Intelligence and Analytics","description":"The module will cover the introductory topics of business intelligence, business analytics and business data science. The students will learn basic analytics concepts, principles and techniques and will see how the data collection, description, visualisation and analysis can help businesses, governments and other organisations make more informed decisions. The module will also cover topics on discovering, measuring and visualising relationships in data, and basics of forecasting and data mining. Examples of real cases studies will illustrate the practical potential, and special emphasis will be given on discussing what the main pitfalls in using different analytical techniques are, such as “lying with descriptive statistics”, misleading visualisation, data overfitting, or why “forecasts are always wrong”. The module will rely on a spreadsheet software to support the computing and visualisation side and will teach the students useful approaches that will prove invaluable for their future studies and employment. Finally, the students will learn how to write reports for the management based on the produced results. It is important to understand basics of analytics even if students do not intend to get an analytics job, because it is critical to business strategy, and so there is a great professional advantage in being able to interact competently with analytics teams. This module aims to shake students out of the belief that organisations and individuals may be able to successfully live without the use of data and analytics."},{"title":"Human-Computer Interaction","description":"This module aims to provide theoretical and practical knowledge about the design, implementation and evaluation of interactive systems. More specifically: To provide students with knowledge of human factors needed to be considered when designing interactive systems, and skills of applying them in specific scenarios To provide students with knowledge of the methods of collecting and analysing user data within the design process To sensitise students to the importance of human aspects of system design and values To supplement this with practical applications of the principles learnt in small but real system design Familiarise students with practical implementations in Human Computer Interaction"},{"title":"Media Coding & Processing","description":"This module introduces students to how digital media is encoded, compressed and presented in a computerised environment. It also teaches how media content can be processed in order to provide more information about it, automatically annotate and classify it, or make it easier to find and handle. It discusses all aspects from the basics of human perceptions over media presentation, coding and digitisation, compression, to advanced media processing. It will also help the students to understand the underlying mathematical principles and how they are being used within coding and different media processing schemes. Within the module the basic media types are covered, i.e. images, audio and video. The following areas are looked at: Mathematical Principles; Human Perception; Representation of Media & Coding; Media Compression & Compression Standards; Image Processing; Video Processing."},{"title":"Product and Service Innovation","description":"The objective of this course is to equip you to meet the challenge in managing product and service innovation processes, especially in the small business environment. The aim is to inspire your enthusiasm and understanding of innovation and encourage the practice of tracking and evaluating the impact of innovations, so vital to anyone in business. These include building motivation, developing a critical and active approach to learning as well as developing ability to link understanding of contemporary innovation to theory."},{"title":"Understanding culture","description":"‘Understanding Culture’ gives an insight into twentieth and twenty-first century definitions and analyses of ‘culture’. Some key questions we explore on the module include: How has ‘culture’ been defined and how have these definitions changed during the 19th, 20th and 21st century? How does culture define who we are? What is the relationship between ‘culture’ and ‘power’? How does a ‘culture’ endorse or suppress markers of identity? How is normativity constructed, questioned or undermined? How can cultural studies and their methodologies help us to understand artistic expressions and cultural practices, and to constructively respond to what matters to others? What role does the body play in our understanding of culture? These questions are approached through a variety of texts from different genres, including public lectures, cultural theory, essay, poetry, investigative journalism, and artistic interventions. Throughout the course students are encouraged to approach cultures as standing in relation to each other, to develop cultural critical self-awareness, and intercultural competence."},{"title":"Selling for Entrepreneurs","description":"Being able to sell is an important skill for anyone pursuing an entrepreneurial career, whether this be to start their own business, or whilst working within an existing organization. This course will focus on two key areas. The first will be to understand what makes a good sales pitch and how to craft a powerful story that persuades customers or colleagues about the benefits of your venture (or project or idea) and also about yourself and your team. In this part of the course you will gain an understanding of persuasion, of selling and of creating legitimacy for entrepreneurial endeavours. Second, you will have a first-hand opportunity to experience selling and to work on refining your sales pitches. At the same time the course makes use of video exercises to enhance skill acquisition and also as a basis for self-reflection. The course will also involve our entrepreneurs in residence who will help to guide you through the process and provide feedback on your sales pitches."},{"title":"Gender Studies: Identities, Inequalities and Politics","description":"Have you ever wondered why women in Britain are paid, on average, 13% less than men? Why women’s bodies are used in advertising? Do you think that class is a women’s issue? Is being white simply about skin colour? Does the Law treat men and women in the same way? Are these questions relevant to the world we inhabit? This course explores such questions."},{"title":"Management and Organisation in Context","description":"The aim of this module is to begin your exploration of the ideas and practices of management, work and organisation in contemporary society, and to introduce you to the conceptual and critical tools that you can use to evaluate the knowledge and views you will encounter. This module will not teach you ‘how to manage’. Management as a practice is not one that can be learned from simplistic, step-by-step guides, though many exist (one of our objectives is to encourage you to critique such approaches). Whilst some elements of organisation, management and specialist roles (such as accounting, operations management or marketing) can usefully deploy systematic techniques and procedures, our focus here is on how people are organised and managed and how they experience that. Such processes and experiences cannot be reduced to ‘management made simple’, because it isn’t. We regard management and organisation as elements of cultural and social processes that we have come to regard as ‘normal’ and ‘natural’ in the sense of being taken for granted. As such we consider the historical development of management ideas and how those ideas develop and work in the contemporary context."},{"title":"The Sociological Imagination","description":"This course offers a general introduction to sociological issues, ideas, concepts, evidence and argument by examining some key aspects of the contemporary world. The topic areas covered in the lectures include: privatisation, identity, globalisation, city lives. A number of different sociological skills are emphasised in order to provide basic tools for applying sociological reasoning in relation to empirical examples. It provides a general understanding of sociology for all and a foundation for more advanced study."},{"title":"Geographies of Health: understanding and tackling inequity","description":"Health and healthcare are central to living a good life yet huge inequalities can be seen, whether locally to Lancaster in the North-West of England or in the Global South. In this module, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the concepts, methods and applications of Health Geographies. Geographers and scholars from related disciplines have made important contributions to defining these inequalities as ethically unacceptable (i.e. inequitable), and providing insights into their causes (political, social, economic and environmental). Geographical thought and research also provides useful tools for developing and critically analysing appropriate policy responses to tackling these inequities. Following an introduction to the diverse geographies of health, we then spend three weeks of lectures and seminars exploring health inequalities in depth, taking a justice perspective as our starting point. We examine the social and economic determinants of health and disease in both the Global North and Global South and also start to interrogate the ‘causes of the causes’ using a political economy approach. In Week 5 we overview the (somewhat contradictory) geographies of healthcare and delivery including critical ‘biopolitical’ perspectives on the state’s role in maintaining its citizens as well as using GIS and other technologies to design efficient and effective health-care delivery. Subsequently, we spend the next 4 weeks applying the theories and approaches covered so-far to four important and exciting frontiers in health geography. These draw on critical works in medical anthropology (knowledge and power); human geography (mental health, space and place); a global health priority – the persistent and emerging nutritional changes facing children in the 21st century; inter-disciplinary environmental sciences (albeit we adopt a more critical perspective on understanding the health impacts of climate change). The final week is dedicated to consolidating the material introduced with the first nine weeks activities in which the task is to link across the diverse theoretical approaches to health within the field of health geography, drawing on a range of case studies covering a place, social group or disease."},{"title":"Environmental Law","description":"The aim of this module is to examine the current law of the environment as it applies to England and Wales. This module will also consider wider aspects of Environmental Law such as the overarching principles and policy; as well as some of the International Environmental Law obligations that bind the UK. On successful completion of this module, students will have an understanding of the principles of Environmental Law and be able to critically analyse specific elements of environmental regimes. The topics covered in this course will provide students with a knowledge of the key environmental regimes that apply in England and Wales. Students will be able to identify and engage with key issues of Environmental Law. Specific areas covered could include: principles of environmental law: environmental regulation and permitting; civil liability; climate change; waste management; and water pollution."},{"title":"Structuring Complex Problems","description":"Issues and problems in the complex world of management do not necessarily arise in a well structured form. People often do not know what they want or what is possible. Further, they may disagree about what they are trying to achieve and the means for arriving at their goals. Much thinking needs to be done in order to define an appropriate framework within which a useful analysis or project can be carried out. Various approaches have been developed in recent years to assist in this task, often referred to as problem structuring methods (PSMs). They are very practically oriented methodologies that typically involve the management team to help facilitate the structuring of complex situations. They place emphasis on dialogue to think through strategic problems, identify the salient issues, formulate goals and negotiate action plans. This course will introduce you to several PSMs and some of the process skills to use them."},{"title":"International Law","description":"The aims of this module are to give an introduction to the central elements of public international law. The topics should give students a basic knowledge of how international law works, its foundations, principles, as well as an understanding of its shortcomings and challenges. The areas introduced will cover different aspects of international law and should enable the students to identify legal issues in current international affairs. Specific areas covered are: the nature of the international legal system; the sources and subjects of international law; international law’s interaction with domestic law; jurisdiction; state responsibility; different territorial regimes; the environment; use of force; the laws of armed conflict; international crimes and other relevant aspects of international law."},{"title":"Geosocial Spaces","description":"This module explores a range of ‘Geosocial Spaces’ – sites where social life meets and mixes with a dynamic Earth. While topics will be approached primarily from a social science perspective, we also highlight the connections between human and physical geographies, and explore insights from the Earth sciences. Topics to be taught include: Changing ways of thinking about the Earth: from a stable planet to a shifting, changeable Earth system. The Anthropocene: human impacts on the Earth system and the question of how humans acquired the power to impact upon Earth processes. How thinking through deep time and large-scale geological processes can change our understanding of social life. Engaging with the subsurface: what it means to inhabit the Earth `vertically’ as well as dwelling on the Earth’s surface Controversies over the use of geological resources: how they emerge and how they might be addressed. Living with geo-hazards: the volatile Earth as both a threat and an incitement for social change Future possibilities: exploring new options such as using the heat of magma as an energy source and mining asteroids for their minerals."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":68,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.1,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":90,"upperBound":102},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":100,"upperBound":140}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.65,"upperBound":3.92},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7.5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":null}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":89,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.03,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":95,"upperBound":97},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"CA":{"amount":35,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.03,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":95,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6.5,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"RW":{"amount":10,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.5,"upperBound":3.97},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null}},"CW":{"amount":15,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.26,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":95,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":7.5,"upperBound":8}}}}},{"link":"https://iisma.kemdikbud.go.id/info/61-university-of-leicester/","name":"University

Crannogs 1100-1350 ","description":"This course critically examines the archaeology of Ireland during the high medieval period from c.1100 until the mid-14th century. The background to the coming of the Anglo-Normans to Ireland in 1169 and the impact they had on the landscape are discussed in depth in the first part of the course. Themes for this section of the course will include the role of castles, the manorial economy, trade, the foundation of villages, rural boroughs and towns by mostly English immigrants and the growth of certain cities. Dispersed settlement in Anglo-Norman parts of eastern Ireland will also be explored. In particular, in the first part of the course, the interplay between castle, town and countryside in Anglo-Norman Ireland is examined in detail. It must also be remembered that large parts of Ireland remained in some way under the control of Irish (Gaelic Irish) princes and lords. The Norman conquest in Ireland in the years after 1169 was only partial, unlike England in 1066 which saw the complete takeover of that country by William the Conqueror. Lectures in this section of the course will examine the nature of Irish settlement in the period under review and will argue that while there was much change, continuity from the pre-Norman early medieval period was seen too. Themes in this part of the course will include the late use of crannogs, ringforts, the Irish adoption of moated sites as princely residences and native agricultural practices. The course will also deal with the changes of the 14th century and the virtual collapse of the Anglo-Norman colony across large parts of Ireland at this time.

This concept breaks down the disciplinary divisions between arts, humanities and sciences to create a structure of foundational knowledge, telling an interconnected story of the universe, Solar System, Earth, life and humanity at the largest scales. Although invented in its Anglophone variety by a historian, David Christian, Big History explicitly looks to a variety of scientific disciplines concerned with change over time, such as astronomy, geology, and biology, alongside the more familiar Humanities and Social Science techniques of history and archaeology. By the end of the module, students will have been introduced to a broad-based ‘tool-kit’ of methods and techniques by which to interrogate both the human and non-human past. They will also have a better understanding of where the histories they will study during the rest of their time at university, as well as their own lives and times, fit into the grand narratives of the Universe, the planet, and the human species."},{"title":"Interconnected World: Foundations of Human and Development Geographies","description":"This module introduces students to the main principles of human geography.

Two fieldtrips are normally part of this module, both concentrating on ancient and medieval landscapes within reach of Dublin by coach."},{"title":"Intro to Celtic Civilization","description":"This introductory module provides students with an overview of the origins, languages, literatures and mythologies of the Celts from prehistoric to medieval times. It forms a solid foundation from which students can progress to study the legacy of the Celts in greater detail at stages 2 and 3. The first half of the module begins with a survey of the main periods of Celtic archaeology and then considers how the Celts were portrayed by Classical Greek and Roman authors, our only written sources for the history of ancient Celtic Europe. Following this, English translations of legal and historical texts composed in Ireland from the seventh century onwards are drawn upon to build up a picture of life in the medieval Celtic world, considering topics such as the structure of early Irish society and the role of women. In the second half of the module, students will be introduced to the main genres of early Irish literature. This rich tradition will complement insights gained in the first half of the module. Students will focus on reading texts within the contemporary medieval context and will become familiar with the diversity of the early Irish literary tradition. The module will also address recent scholarship in relation to the interpretation of the relevant literature. Following an examination of approaches and sources, the module will focus on selected genres. One approach categorises the literature into four main sections.

Beginners’ modules in medieval Irish and Welsh are also available for those wishing to study the languages of the primary sources."},{"title":"Vikings in the Celtic World","description":"This course will consider the Viking experience of the Celtic-speaking lands and how the Vikings, through both confrontation and collaboration, had a transformative impact on that world between c. 780-1020. The Vikings were largely a silent people and it is largely through the eyes of those they encountered ‘peoples who were already literate’ that we first get to know them. Many of our enduring images of the Vikings are based on sources from the Celtic world, and some of the earliest and most complete accounts of the initial Viking raids are found in the Irish annals. As the Vikings become a permanent presence in these lands, the Celtic and Norse views of the spiritual, heroic and economic world intersected and, at times, collided. We will look at the manner in which the Vikings are treated in literature and how this changes over time. We will trace the survival of rituals and beliefs brought from Scandinavia as exemplified by the decorated slabs and burials on the Isle of Man, where legends from Norse mythology feature on Christian crosses and a warrior was buried with a sacrificed slave. There were personalities, both Norse and Celtic, who straddled both worlds, and many of these men and women were nurtured in both traditions and reflect the enduring and transforming contacts made through intermarriage, fosterage and political alliances. The emergence of new dynasties and kingdoms is a product of the special circumstances of this period and we will consider how they arise and what their impact was on the wider Norse and Celtic worlds. Towns develop in the west and the north as a result of the Vikings’ new raiding/trading activities, and the connections between the contemporary developments of Dublin, Waterford and Limerick in Ireland and Kaupang, Birka and Hedeby in Scandinavia will be surveyed. This multifaceted course will provide students with a clear understanding of this fascinating and dynamic period in the history of the Norse and Celtic worlds."},{"title":"Kings and Heroes of Early Irl","description":"The Ulster Cycle tales are among the best-known narratives of Early Irish literature (c. 700-1200 AD). The tales depict the heroic society of pagan Ireland and the rivalry for supremacy between Ulster and Connacht. We will study, in translation, not just the centre-piece of the cycle (The ‘Táin’ or ‘Cattle Raid of Cooley’), but also other major and minor tales, which offer an introduction to the wide variety of themes, genres, and literary styles of one branch of this uniquely early literature. Among the most attractive and accessible of the Early Irish tales are those dealing with the lives of legendary or early historical kings and heroes, such as Cormac mac Airt, about whom many tales have survived. We will read these sagas in translation, to discover how legendary and historical kings are presented as admirable or otherwise, what the desirable characteristics of an ideal king were, and how the demands of kingship were reconciled with the king’s human needs. More generally we consider what were the pressing concerns of the social and political ruling elites of Early Ireland, and how how they were encoded and explored in a memorable literature."},{"title":"UCD Gamelan Ensemble 1","description":"This module provides an opportunity for students to become familiar with the art music tradition of Central Java by performing in the gamelan ensemble.

Is contemporary writing defined by its relevance, its artistry, or its socio-political concerns? How do writers compose and structure their works? This module will introduce readers to a range of contemporary Irish writings, spanning non-fiction, the novel, short stories and poetry, closely examining the choice of theme, the significance of form, and the nature of the works’ impact. In analysing the depiction of contemporary Irish urban and rural society in contemporary fiction, we will engage with ongoing debates concerning the function and importance of literary representation in the context of social crisis and change. The interrogation of irishness and identity in the course texts will be examined as will writers’ preoccupation with the transnational and the global. Workshop discussions, supporting the core lectures, will also examine how these contemporary writings have been received to date by readers and critics, and trace the ongoing processes whereby the reputations of texts and their writers are formed and shaped. Each workshop will also incorporate formal exercises designed to ensure that first year students acquire the necessary skills for studying English: writing and close-reading; note-taking, research, and referencing; and effective use of electronic resources such as online journals, dedicated websites, reviews in news media."},{"title":"Introduction to Film and Media","description":"The contemporary era is marked both by a proliferation of screens through which we access ‘content’, as well as fundamental and ongoing shifts in the media industries, largely driven by digital innovation.

The interaction between transport and land use receives specific attention, leading to mass regional urbanisation. The changing urban form raises questions about strategic planning and metropolitan governance. Urban and Regional Development: Cities have undergone an urban renaissance over the past decades. Globalisation is the cause both of a deep urban crisis of the 1970s and the formation of world cities in which capital and economic activity is concentrated. Social and Environmental Challenges: The current urbanisation process goes along with two fundamental challenges. Climate change has resulted in increased vulnerability and a need to mitigate its causes and adapt to an increase in extreme weather events. Urban inequality is second big challenge for cities, including issues of residential segregation and gentrification.

Its interactive sessions allow students to delve into the issues of creativity, idea generation, opportunity recognition and feasibility analysis, thus, enabling them to understand how to set the foundations of an entrepreneurial business model. Through various activities, students work towards exploring business opportunities, which allows them to learn about businesses, make decisions about various aspects related to those businesses, and be entrepreneurial."},{"title":"Science & Society: An Ethical View ","description":"Advances in science have profoundly changed how we view ourselves, how we view the world, and how we live in societies. Scientists are called on to tackle the biggest challenges facing us now, such as climate change and the Covid-19 crisis. This is because the scientific method is widely understood as the most reliable route to knowledge. Any negative effects from scientific advancement, such as the predicted disruption from widespread use of AI, are seen as necessary for progress. But are there limits to what scientific thinking can help us solve? Is more and better science always the answer? Why is it good to be scientific? Are there ever reasonable grounds for distrusting science? These kinds of questions are about the value, purpose, and ethics of science. Because they cannot be answered by the scientific method, they may rarely be considered by scientists themselves. This module – co-taught by scientists from the Chemistry school, and ethicists from the IDEA Centre, with expertise in online teaching methods – will allow you to explore the inter-relation between science and ethics. We look at the theory of science, and explore real-world developments and industry practices, to understand what good and bad science looks like.We will consider questions such as: is the scientific method the superior method for finding answers, or does it have limits? How can science be misused, and the work of scientists be morally compromised? Is it possible to judge the contribution of science to society on a moral basis, or is morality just a matter of subjective opinion? Should scientists be allowed to pursue knowledge for the sake of it, or should they work for the interests of society? In taking this module, you will learn about the science underpinning real-world problems, alongside philosophical and ethical theories, while developing skills in debate, analysis, and critical argument, to help you develop your own answers to those questions."},{"title":"Introduction to Psychology ","description":"This module will cover key and current concepts within the subject of Psychology. Psychology is the science of the mind. It is a science because it aims to explain the greatest number of facts with the fewest number of assumptions, its hypotheses should be falsifiable by empirical tests, and its theories are connected to other sciences. The relevance of Psychology is very important to everyday life. This introduction to psychology will touch on some of the classic controversies including nature and nurture, the relationship between brain and mind, different approaches to understanding mental health, and how we process, store and use information about ourselves and other people. The approach embraces the diversity of perspectives within the discipline including experimental, cognitive, and developmental psychology, as well as biology and philosophy."},{"title":"Psychology in the Media ","description":"This module introduces all of the main areas of contemporary psychology: cognitive, social, health and developmental. In doing so, it addresses common misconceptions about psychology: eg ‘You know what I’m thinking.’In turn, it describes how media influences programmes of scientific research, how public opinion is altered by media representations, and how Psychology has plotted a course through intense media interest and has ensured its strong scientific base. Central to the course is the discussion of how it is necessary to be critical of science in the media, and how common sense explanations need a basis in scientific evidence."},{"title":"History of Psychology","description":"Can there be a science of the mind?- If so, what should it look like? Since the nineteenth century, the most extraordinary range of answers has been given to these questions. The phrenologists, for instance, turned psychology into the study of bumps on the skull, on the view that your particular set of bumps would reveal your unique talents and character. The psychoanalysts turned psychology into the study of the unconscious, where, they said, your mind locks away wishes and impulses too shameful to be acted upon. The behaviourists turned psychology into the study of reactions to stimuli, attempting to show that your environment made you who you are and, if changed, could remake you.- How did these different understandings of what psychology is come into being? – Why did each have its moment of popularity, only to be overtaken by a new answer? – Where does the truth lie? In this module we will be looking not just at a remarkable set of ideas about what psychology is, but at the people behind the ideas, from Darwin to Freud to Chomsky and beyond. Anyone curious to know more about the mind and its study will enjoy this module. There are no prerequisites."},{"title":"Diverse Contexts of Learning ","description":"In this module you will explore how learning is shaped by social, cultural and economic contexts. You will consider some of the philosophical perspectives underlying approaches to education across the globe. You will also look at the sociological aspects of education and the ways that different contexts are influenced by their socio-economic settings. You will reflect on your own prior experiences as a learner and how your learning was affected by the contexts in which it took place."},{"title":"Natural Hazards","description":"How do tsunamis form and why are they so destructive?- What can be done to minimise their impact? – Why was the response to the Sumatran tsunami wrong? – How many Bangladeshi lives could be saved for the same amount of money as the annual subsidy on an EU cow? Come and find out the answers to these questions and hundreds more, across the whole spectrum of Natural Hazards. Such hazards annually take 10,000’s of lives and cause billions of pounds of damage. Examine the physical processes that control natural disasters and learn what can be done to minimise the death and destruction caused by these events. Topics covered include volcanoes, earthquakes, flooding, hurricanes, landslides and meteorite impacts. Two lectures are also included on tsunamis, and the science behind the Boxing Day Sumatra, and Japan tsunami. We also touch upon the response of societies to natural hazards. We can be 100% certain that thousands of people will be killed by natural hazards during the duration of the course, and we will examine some of these ‘current’ events during the course. The course gets fantastic feedback, for instance: “People not even on this course come along anyway just because it is enjoyable and people speak so highly of it? “Why not just sign up! No previous science background is required."},{"title":"Arts and Cultural Management","description":"This module will be of particular interest to students interested in learning more about: the Creative, Performing and Visual Arts; Theatre, Music and Design; Museum Studies; Cultural Studies; English Literature; Management and Business Studies. The module aims to enhance participantsâ€™ employability and cultural insight by exploring the benefits and challenges of applying business and management theory to the arts and culture. It is tailored towards students seeking to acquire a deeper understanding of Arts and Cultural Management and explore the key practices and theoretical debates in this dynamic and growing field."},{"title":"Understanding Digital Media","description":"This module provides students with an overview of key issues in the study of digital media. The module focuses on key concepts that have shaped digital media’s brief history and that have been said to differentiate digital media from older media forms. It develops students’ understanding of the cultural, political, economic and technical contexts from which digital media have emerged. The module forms the foundation for more detailed analyses of digital media in future years."},{"title":"Cultural History","description":"This introductory module maps out some of the social and cultural formations underscoring the history of ‘the West’ since the period known as the Enlightenment. It invites undergraduate students at the very beginning of their studies to engage with history from a cultural perspective, develop a ‘sense of history’ and reflect on what might be understood as ‘historical consciousness’. We draw on historical events, developments and concepts to interrogate some of the ideological and political assumptions informing modernity and postmodernity. Using a wide variety of materials, we also consider how race, ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality have been figured and represented since the Enlightenment. The texts that students encounter range from philosophical, constitutional and sociological writings to autobiography, fiction, photography and film. The contexts in which these will be explored include Enlightenment philosophy, the ‘Age of Revolutions’, enslavement and colonialism, 20th century war and the modern city. The contemporary legacies of the Enlightenment age will also be examined in relation to cultural memory, postmodernism, post- and transhumanism."},{"title":"International Politics","description":"This module starts by providing a brief historical context, to cover some of the key developments in world politics to date. Some of the most important concepts in International Politics are introduced in this context: the international system, war, peace, sovereignty, collective security, inequality, and international organisations.The main aim of this module is to introduce students to the key international issues we face today, and the puzzles these raise. This includes explaining what shaped the world we live in, and understanding the patterns of international politics (including how interests, institutions, and interactions matter in international relations). We also discuss some key structures and processes in this context, such as the changing character of war, violence by non-state actors, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Students get introduced to the main issues pertaining to transnational politics, such as human rights, the United Nations, international law, humanitarian intervention and ‘the Responsibility to Protect’. The module also introduces students to regionalism in international affairs, and in particular to the international politics of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, to illustrate the variety of concepts that shape our understanding of global politics.Essential for comprehending the background behind the events that dominate our daily news, International Politics is the key if you want to make sense of the increasingly global political world that we all now inhabit."},{"title":"Beginners Korean","description":"Beginners Korean 10 credits is for students who have not previously studied Korean. The emphasis is on achieving a basic level of communication in speaking, listening, reading and writing and an introduction to Korean culture.

It begins with an interrogation of the way development practices and ideas are embedded in cultural contexts, and specifically how the development industry is historically and culturally entangled in Western conceptions of progress, rationality, and the individual. Against a view of culture as ‘tradition’ and an impediment to development we will examine different cultural conceptions of progress. This involves both alternate visions of future development as well as the negative impacts that development policies and interventions have on local people, communities and cultures. Questions of power and cultural relativism inevitably arise: what happens when different interests and commitments collide, and who or what determines the module development interventions take?"},{"title":"Research Skills for Development","description":"This module is an introduction to the research methods, techniques and skills used in development research and provides a foundation for the International Development thesis in the third year. The module is taught through workshops during which you focus on practical issues to do with research skills, as well as consider some of the more abstract issues that inform how we do research. The module encourages you to think about research ethics and the linkages between project design and methods of data collection. During the module team work is emphasised, and many of the workshops involve hands-on group work."},{"title":"Digital Environment","description":"Digital media saturates everyday life, re-organises cultural productions of all kinds, and re-mediates the teaching and learning environments which you will inhabit at Sussex. The course aims to examine this digital environment through both practical and theoretical perspectives. It enables you to understand and use digital tools to enhance and explore your study and to take a critically informed stance on your existing practices. The course examines developments in new media with a particular emphasis on different uses of digital media, enabling you to make distinctions between kinds of material, genres and platforms. Through a practical approach it equips you to use digital media confidently to both enhance study and to understand the digital environment as media and cultural form. The course covers topics including data visualisation, searching for resources, citation, catalogues, mapping, archiving, using social media, privacy, copyright and surveillance, digital media as a research area (e.g. how to research and ethics of researching tweets / Wikipedia / social forums) and the politics of software. The course will draw upon a range of digital research platforms, including those owned and/or subscribed to by the university in order to provide a solid foundation for you to embark on future independent research."},{"title":"Global Cultures, Local Lives","description":"This module explores anthropology as an exciting, ‘living’ subject, alive to the concerns of different communities and populations living across the globe, and as cutting edge in terms of the research conducted by anthropologists at Sussex as they actively engage with issues of social, cultural and global transformation. This is accomplished through a module structure which revolves around 5 core themes considered central to the subject that capture anthropological thinking on the subjects of culture, identity and representation: kinship; self and body; economy as culture; religion and politics; and work on the global-local interface."},{"title":"Human Factors & Ergonomics","description":"This module provides a foundation of principles for human-centred design that will be relevant throughout your degree programme. Initially there is a focus on physical considerations, including a study of human limits for inclusive design. Later on people’s behaviour is considered and how design can help to address significant issues for society. We also consider contemporary adaptations that embrace social factors, including consumer behaviour and a services approach to design. Finally we adopt a global perspective and understand more about society in developing countries and how design can help to address concerns. Topics will include: introduction to human factors, ergonomics, anthropometrics, the senses, mock ups to evaluate ergonomic principles, designing a handheld object (anthropometrics, anatomy and physiology of the hand), consumer behaviour, inclusive design, design for a sustainable society, cradle to cradle approaches, taking a systems approach to design, research methods for understanding lifestyle and context of use, global issues and design concerns."},{"title":"Critical Approaches 1","description":"How do we go about reading and interpreting a literary text? What are we trying to do when we analyse a work of literature? Are we trying to establish one correct interpretation? How do we decide that some interpretations are more valuable than others? Do we need to understand the original intentions of the author to understand what something means? Is it necessary to understand the historical or political situation from which a work emerged? Do readers interpret texts differently at different historical moments? Could our interpretations of texts be affected by forces beyond our control, forces such as the workings of language, unconscious desires, class, race, gender, sexuality or nationality? How is it that some texts, Shakespeare’s plays, for instance, are highly valued by our culture, while others have been lost or devalued? Who or what decides which literature will survive to be read and studied on English courses? Critical Approaches 1 will suggest some ways of answering these large and difficult questions about interpretation, and aims to help you think in new ways about the work you do for your English degree at Sussex. In the autumn you will study the themes: “What is literature? Why does it matter?”, “Theories of Language and Meaning: Structuralism and Poststructuralism” and “Ideology and Discourse.” Throughout the module you will read critical and theoretical essays and literary works that contribute to your understanding of these themes. The module will examine many different aspects of literary theory including new criticism, Marxism, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, feminism, post-colonial theory, psychoanalysis and queer theory."},{"title":"Global Issues","description":"The module aims to offer an introduction to a range of contemporary issues in global politics. Each week deals with a different global issue (e.g. development, poverty, economic sanctions, terrorism, emerging powers, migration, environment etc). The exact themes vary each year to cover the latest developments and crises in global politics. Most sessions start with an introduction to the theme by the module convenor and are followed by class activities (group discussion, presentations, debates, simulation games etc). The introduction by the convenor does not replicate the ‘required readings’, but expands or offers a different view to these readings and the issues under discussion. Similarly, student presentations do not focus on required readings but aim to cover contemporary ‘case-studies’ related to the themes under discussion."},{"title":"News, Politics and Power A","description":"This module explores media and politics and, more broadly, the media and questions of power. It focuses on current affairs with a stress on news; although other forms of factual content (for instance TV docudrama, web blogs, broadsheet lifestyle spin-offs) are also covered. This module considers the role media can play in producing our understanding of the globalizing world in which we live. It asks how media frames, organises, and contextualises events, both as they take place, and in relation to the collective memories that emerge after the event. It also asks how the media themselves are managed, manipulated, and influenced â€“ variously by governments, media owners, professional newsrooms codes, and/or by public pressure. You will examine the role the media play in relation to the citizen and the state. It is through the optic of citizenship, particularly in relation to the public sphere, that questions concerning the power of the media are addressed. You will also explore how a wide range of media contribute to the maintenance or erosion of a democratic society and an informed citizenship."},{"title":"Introduction to Human Rights","description":"This module will introduce you to the diversity of human rights issues and the different approaches that disciplines take in this field. Each week, a member of faculty drawn from one of a number of departments (including law, anthropology, politics and history) will consider a different human rights theme in which they have specific expertise. Subjects may include human rights and immigration, reproductive rights, rights to sexual orientation, genocide, women’s rights, children’s rights, minority rights and the United Nations human rights institutions."},{"title":"Historical Controversy","description":"This module introduces you to the study of history through the critical reading of a key historical text. In this way you will gain an understanding of the complexity of the historical record and an appreciation of a range of problems associated with the interpretation of evidence. You will also think about the discipline of history and the nature of historical enquiry. Through a study of how historians have formulated and deployed their arguments, you will begin to learn to deploy ideas and to shape your own historical arguments."},{"title":"Morality, Groups and Emotion","description":"This module will provide an overview of key debates within moral psychology, such as the definition of morality, rationalism, emotionism, and nativism. Students will consider multiple theories and research which provides insight about how moral judgements are related to cognitions, emotions, and social identities. The consequences of the moral emotions will be discussed, considering implications for mental health, interpersonal relationships, and social equalities."},{"title":"News, Politics and Power B","description":"This module explores media and politics and, more broadly, the media and questions of power. It focuses on current affairs with a stress on news; although other forms of factual content (for instance TV docudrama, web blogs, broadsheet lifestyle spin-offs) are also covered. The module considers the role media can play in producing our understanding of the globalizing world in which we live. It asks how media frame, organize, and contextualize events, both as they take place, and in relation to the collective memories that emerge after the event. It also asks how the media themselves are managed, manipulated, and influenced â€“ variously by governments, media owners, professional newsrooms codes, and/or by public pressure. Finally the module is centrally concerned with the role the media play in relation to the citizen and the state. It is through the optic of citizenship, particularly in relation to the public sphere, that questions concerning the power of the media are addressed. Thus the module explores how a wide range of media contribute to the maintenance or erosion of a democratic society and an informed citizenship."},{"title":"Understanding Global Migration","description":"This interdisciplinary module focuses on the profound impact of human migration on the world we live in. It explores a range of geographical, economic, political, social and cultural issues surrounding migration. The module introduces the key theories, concepts and ideas used to define and understand migration, and covers the main types, causes and consequences of migration. Following a roughly chronological sequence in order to foster a sense of historical continuity and change, it covers topics such as labour migration, refugees, irregular migration, integration and exclusion, migration and development, and the impact of gender on the migration process."},{"title":"Modern Political Thought","description":"This module addresses some of the most important texts in the history of western political philosophy. It covers the work of seven major political thinkers and aims to provide you with knowledge of the broad contours of modern political thought from the 17th to the 20th century. You will develop your ability to analyse philosophical arguments and to situate the texts studied in the appropriate historical contexts. Throughout, the aim will be to encourage close textual reading whilst developing an awareness of the wider themes and concepts that inform modern political thought."},{"title":"Education for Development: Aid, Policy and the Global Agenda","description":"This module introduces international education and development through three lenses. The module first examines why education is seen as important for development, drawing upon economic, rights based and socio cultural perspectives. It then examines the way education is measured and targets are set for development. The final section of the module introduces the international actors and political economy of delivering the education for all agenda. The module provides grounding in education and international development, with a particular focus on the challenges facing resource-constrained and rapidly expanding educational systems. This will equip students with an understanding of the role of education in international development and develop critical, political and methodological perspectives."},{"title":"Global Climate Change","description":"This module takes an interdisciplinary view on the scientific basis of claims of global climate change, the human responsibility and the future implications of the change. In doing so it is largely based around theoretical and evidence based elements of climate science. Half of the module is dedicated to providing a sound basis for undergraduate level critical understanding of the science of contemporary climate change for the present-day and in the future. The other half provides the foundations for a critical understanding of the basis of future climate impacts."},{"title":"Reason and Argument","description":"The aim of this module is to help you to become reflective about the way arguments work by looking at a number of paradoxes. Paradoxes puzzle and perplex us. If you’re going to sort them out, you have to clearly lay out the arguments and assumptions that lie behind the puzzlement and perplexity. And doing that helps you to see how to analyse arguments more generally. You’ll see that most paradoxes have several solutions. Understanding the reasons in favour of different solutions will help you to see how arguments work, and how assumptions are often in play ones that you may not have thought about before."},{"title":"Comparative Public Policy","description":"Why do public policies differ from country to country? How can we explain these differences? Why are some governments more successful than others in solving particular policy problems? These are the key questions that will be explored in this introductory module to comparative public policy. The first part of the module explores theoretical issues relevant to the analysis of public policy, including both the stages of policy process and the main theories put forward to explain cross-national and temporal differences in public policy. The second part of the module uses these theoretical tools to examine in detail specific policies, including welfare and social policy, pension policy, family policy, labour market policy, immigration policy, and education policy. For each policy area, we will examine the roles of various actors, interests and institutions in the policy process, as well as the influence of broader structures and ideas in policy making."},{"title":"Colonialism and After","description":"This module is an introduction to a range of key historical problems and conceptual questions relating to the colonial and postcolonial experiences. Focusing on the characteristics of capitalism, imperialism, and modernity, you will examine the making of the modern world."},{"title":"Sussex Perspectives on International Development","description":"You’ll get a foundation to the study of international development and an explanation of key concepts in development studies. Each week, you explore a concept through the research experience of Sussex lecturers discussing “real places” and “real issues”."}],"intakeStatistics":{"2022":{"RA":{"amount":576,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3,"upperBound":4},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":82,"upperBound":99},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":6,"upperBound":8.5},"DET":{"lowerBound":75,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":15,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.28,"upperBound":3.95},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":8.5,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":160}}},"2023":{"RA":{"amount":161,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.1,"upperBound":3.98},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":85,"upperBound":100},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":5.5,"upperBound":8},"DET":{"lowerBound":80,"upperBound":160}},"RW":{"amount":15,"GPA":{"lowerBound":3.47,"upperBound":3.96},"TOEFL":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"IELTS":{"lowerBound":null,"upperBound":null},"DET":{"lowerBound":140,"upperBound":155}}}}}]}
